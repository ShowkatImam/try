just get it over with death is always at the finish line we will all die no matter what we do so why not die just a couple of years earlier than \\x93planned\\x94 death is death no matter how it happens \\x93suicide\\x94 and \\x93natural death\\x94 is literally the same thing executed in different ways im a junkie who watched the love of my life commit suicide and i\\x92m 16 never failed harder in school than this year probably will have to go to summer school which makes me want to mf kill myself jesus christ why am i so dumb i will die alone hurt this i dont really care i have no reason to keep going im out af hate my life i held a knife to my throat 3 mins ago in the middle of the night i had a note ready and everything i looked in the mirror and reflected on my memories for a moment and ultimately decided to put the knife down and make myself a bowl of ramen knowing nobody cares about you sure makes the thought of killing yourself a lot easier i feel like im just one big mentally traumatic event away from finally deciding to end it all i can\\x92t stop thinking about killing myself i want to die i hate the way i look so much i\\x92ve made my  suicide note i\\x92m so close to ending it i know theres probably always going to be people who love and care for u but when the person that matters hates u u still feel like ending yourself i plan on killing myself as soon as a i get my degree i already fucked up my life permanently and nothing will ever fix it i already donated all my money 200000 to my sister luckily she hasnt told my parents yet i\\x92ve been thinking about killing my self for more than five years now i\\x92ve tried last week but stopped myself i wanna die but at the same time i don\\x92t but i wanna have a failed suicide attempt so i can bring attention of how much i\\x92m hurting i feel guilty for wanting this but i wanna know if anyone else has had this idea or thought i guess anybody please i am going to kill myself i need someone please life\\x92s hard life\\x92s a battle we are at war with ourselves and each other  other people make it look so easy but every night before i sleep i think of ending it i\\x92m worthless and replaceable a few moments ago i just came the closest ive come to suicide in years is it possible to be seriously considering suicide but just not be sad most of the time i dont feel sad i just feel numb i have been thinking about suicide im trying to get help but its hard to be open with therapists about these suicidal thoughts knowing they have the power to put me in the hospital i dont think i need to be there i dont know what that would even accomplish because i dont think theres anything wrong i just dont want to live i feel weak other people are in actual pain and i can understand why they would want to die i dont know why i want to die i just do i dont have a good reason im not sure if i should take this seriously or what i want to die i suffer so much pain i just want to end it all but the process of dying sounds to painful in cutting your wrist or taking sleep pills cause your body shut downs i just want this pain to end want to end it but seem to be still lacking the courage and the most optimum way to end my life im a useless slab of mass nearing its expiry date its pointless im not adding any value to the society shooting yourself seems a bad option to me bc i dont want to live with a deformed face if i survivesorry mom if this is the last you hear of me i feel so relieved thinking about suicide i have this nice feeling of closure when i think about killing myself it makes me feel so good that i\\x92d finally be in a peaceful state and not have to worry about anyone or anything and it just feels so calming to think about i think about suicide nearly every single day lol i just wish i can be happy but my brain doesnt lol i dont know i really dont i cant fight it anymore my head is exploding all my pain is screaming at me and its just too much to take nothing is going to help me nothing ever did i dont even know what to think of myself i feel like cutting myself and have no one to talk to wish i could give my life to someone who wanted it so embarrassed about the police detaining me for a suicide attempt i wont make it in life after high school and plan to end it all after graduation i think i want to end my life for a relationship i ruined with someone years ago i hurt them i feel like i wasted my life i wish i had no one to love me so i could kill myself without hurting people closest to me i made  suicidal attempt last saturday i hate my life i\\x92ve already accepted the fact that i\\x92m going to kill myself before i turn 30 someone please help me i cant think anything my pulse is racing and i feel like doing something crazy so ugly i want to kill myself but worried my ugliness will scare others in my next life the life of an adult in the workforce makes me want to kill myself im going to fucking kill myself i look online and i see all of these articles on how to commit suicide and not one has a method that is painless i just want to die without pain i been attempting to end my life for the past 5 weeks and i can\\x92t failing every single time every night i hope i die in my sleep i feel that in the future i might end up commiting suicide i just see no point to it all it feels like mental torture the world isnt a place for me its nothing like what i expected everything i do ends in failure i wish i had been able to kill myself the first time i tried im always toying with the idea of suicide if i fail school i\\x92m feeling really depressed and lonely and really could use a friend to talk to i feel like sobbing and hurting myself i\\x92m contemplating suicide and hanging myself i\\x92m thinking of trying it from a pulley system thanks goodbye if i don\\x92t get back in time i lost everything and wrote my suicide letter tonight i feel suicidal nothing makes sense in my head daily panic attacks and depressive episodes that are going to turn suicidal soon i know rationally that life wont ever get better for me and im passively suicidal im considering ending my life not sure if ill do it so but if i do i already have a plan try to talk me out of it now i know when im going to kill myself probably on the 21 or 22nd i hope it works ill maybe trainsurf and jump from a building w my wrist

stuck in the psych ward for atleast the weekend what do i do to pass time im in so much debt suicide starts to seem like the better option there are two options either ill never kill myself because im too weak and nobody will ever know how unhappy and suicidal i am yet ill have to live this miserable life for another 60 years or ill finally get the courage to kill myself havent found an easy and safe method yet thoi just want to fall asleep and never wake up again not only that i\\x92m ugly it\\x92s a death sentence should\\x92ve killed myself years ago especially if i knew how shitty my life would turn out i hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it i absolutely hate life there is no way that this will ever be worth it i want to die so bad i can\\x92t kill myself because i don\\x92t want to break my family apart i\\x92m just in so much pain i want to curl up into a ball and waste away my mom will never see how ill i am i don\\x92t even know what i\\x92m doing anymore what i\\x92m living for i feel so fucking useless the only way to make my mom see is to kill myself it will be decided on saturday whether or not i am killing myself i remember last time i tried it i failed n felt like shit for 2 days i don\\x92t want to fail again i\\x92m a low life pathetic piece of shit fucking coward i can\\x92t live this way anymore i can\\x92t deal with it i hate my life my mind my face when i look in the mirror i see me the real me i cringe i don\\x92t like me i hate me i can\\x92t stand looking at me loneliness is making me suicidal i just wish i had someone to talk tomy friends are too busy for and i feel so fucking lonely i genuinely don\\x92t understand the point in life all you do is sleep work or study eat and repeat the miserable cycle there is no point in being alive because i have no purpose i hate everyone in my life and tired of being treated like shit so i am ready to die already i cant comprehend anything im so close to ending it i just dont care anymore and no one seems to ever understand or take me seriously im so sick i feel so bad fuck if it wasn\\x92t for the effect it would have on my parents and my grandparents i would have committed suicide by now i want to die on purpose to make my family feel bad a month ago i was badly depressed that i chose to attempt suicide i overdosed on 1100 mg of seroquel i was in the hospital 6 days being watched and fighting for my lifei almost died and to think about it i wish that i did i am getting back to the way that i was depressed and suicidal the thing is there is no body in my life that cares to even check in on me ive been thinking about killing myself a lot latelyand its soo exhaustingmostly hanging myselfand im afraid one day ill really do iti really cant live anymore i sweari am tired of everythingand sometimeswhen im drivingi get those dark thoughts in my head like speed up and drive off a bridge or when im on the edge of a buildingi get that feeling that i want to jumpim really tired of this just wrote my goodbye note it still feels unreal that im really doing this i have everything planned out already at the start of summer vacation im going to do it so my friends arent distracted from their studies i need to do this this is my only escape i hate this world i don\\x92t think i can do this anymore i wish i was dead i hate the uncertainty that is my life i grasp for air and none is given im alone and waiting for the mistakes to finally hit me i guess saying work is my happy place right now would be quite unorthodox but its the bitter truth when im home im with a man who is supposed to love me he doesnt he wont even get intimate with me anymore despite not knowing where to go if we break up i genuinely just want him to love me and to fix the fault in our relationship it rips me apart but i must keep clear to myself that if a else fails the comfort in dying is always there for me my life is truly just one large tragedy and sometimes i feel like suicide is the only real way out i got into a car accident a few years ago and i wish i had just died being in the hospital was nice because it felt like time stopped all i had to do was sit there and get better and isn\\x92t death kinda similar time just stops and everything stops pressuring you pushing you draining you etc i really just want a long break and sometimes death feels comforting cause i\\x92ll finally get to rest lately i\\x92m thinking about ending things i\\x92ve been couch surfing for 2 months and i\\x92m about to be officially homeless supposed to be starting work next week and honestly not sure if i\\x92m gonna make it until then i have tried once before and i was nearly successfulmy dog kept me alive but he\\x92s being fostered by a family who he loves right now and i wonder if i should ask them to keep him for good so that i can finally be done with life i\\x92m so exhausted so very exhausted the plant that id kill myself with is walking distance from my apartment   i\\x92m sorry mom i don\\x92t want to leave you i really don\\x92t i thought i was doing better but i\\x92m not and i can\\x92t handle it anymore i love you and i\\x92m really going to miss you i\\x92m sorry i am feeling suicidal although my life has been on pause because i\\x92ve been trying to recover from my huge depressive episode in november i still cannot get a grip on life the process of doing counselling medication psychiatrists and exercise literally don\\x92t seem to be working i also have bpd so i always take up hobbies that interest me and help me stay sane for a day or two then i\\x92m back to feeling numb i really want to cut wrists and die right now nothing seems to fill this void other than the idea of me escaping from this world my name is ole and im suicidal 4 months after suicide attempt the dark feelings are coming backmy failed attempt in december made me feel as though i wasn\\x92t meant to die right then and things were a little brighter after that but now my life is feeling pointless again and the dark thoughtsfeelings are coming back can anyone help i fucking hate myself im so tired of living im so dumb and ugly and i sh so much today i just wanna

to feel a little happy im done with this gonna hang myself in a week i thought about jumping from the balcony its only one storie though so i could only break something or end up dead right away or i will suffer all night and end up as a paraplegic the fact that other people are happy makes me suicidal i hoped my last post would be my last post but i\\x92m still here i survived my suicide attempt just turned 17 i am so unhappy was crying in the shower 10 minutes ago texted 2 friends and no one took me seriously i will end my life tonight i am sorry i am ending my life tonight i cant do it anymore i am done tried to choke myself i dont know what i thought it was gonna happen now i just feel more miserable than before i have been depressed for years and just want it to end i tried to jump infront of a train yesterday but im too much of a coward the sooner i get it over with the better i hate being alive im such a coward im actually about to kill myselfive been crying my sleep to sleep crying hysterically now i cant take it anymore im about to go im so alone pleaseim suffering i cant take this anymore just tell me the easiest way to commit suicide im going to hang myself tonight the end yesterday i tried to end my own life when i was out my friend stopped me she\\x92s called me a lot to make sure i\\x92m okay but i don\\x92t want to talk to her because i\\x92m still annoyed she stopped me she knows i\\x92ve been unhappy for a long time she knows i don\\x92t want to be here it\\x92s all i can think about suicide please someone talk to me i don\\x92t know what to do i cant keep living anymore im tired of all this ive decided ill kill mysef by committing seppuku i know its painfull but at least i should die for good im not scared of pain anymore a little pain at the end wont hurt me anymore farewell im lost in life  ive got bad grades no motivation my antidepressants dont do shit i cant sleep what do i fucking do im so stressed with school all i think about 247 is just standing in front of a fucking train and forgetting everything i not going anywhere in life theres no fucking point to try i just wanna get away from everyone and not fucking suffer anymore im just so tired and exhausted of living dying alone seems meaningless to me it\\x92s too bland i would like someone to watch me unfortunately i don\\x92t have anyone that i would like to see in my last moments on earth or anyone that would actually do that for me i guess suicide on livestream is an option too but it isn\\x92t as good as having someone close next to you this feeling of emptiness feeling like death is so much better just waiting to be done with responsibilities i have to move on from this sick world nothing makes me happy anymore when i kill myself i hope everyone knows it\\x92s their faults feeling so suicidal i never had a courage to do it but maybe i can try in a week i cant stand all this pain anymore it is because i always have something to blame every time i fail a test or do something wrong i blame it on adhd i always say my parents should have treated me better but they tried their best i am just an ungrateful useless cunt who got here because i am too self absorbed to realize that im the worst thing that happened to myself and now i must die i am planning to die i hate my life because of my disability and i cant really acheive anything because of my fysical limitations so whats the point of living im in pain every day my stumac hurts people say focus on what you can do but truthfully i cant do shit i skip basis because i bloddy cant do basics this have roots to socializing music sports etc so why shouldnt i just be allowed to kill my self then my daily pain and frustration would be gone im just alone every day i planned on killing myself in 2 months only because i didnt want my friends to be distracted and fail their studies because of grief from my absence and break begins in 2 months but this is already too much this is already such a selfish move on my part so im going to be even more selfish now may 11th my last day on this earth i wish i could talk to some one please all i want to do is kill my self i need somone to talk to im going to kill myself before i turn 19 im 18 in a couple of days ill be in uni and live on my own so i can finally get away from my parents and kill myself in peace i dont want to scar them more than i already will well now i can enjoy the last year of my life thats a plus i know i\\x92ll kill my self i\\x92ve always had troubles with myself i have some mental issues that plague me 247 i try really hard right now to keep afloat yet i don\\x92t know how long i can do it for i\\x92m not saying i\\x92ll do it soon but i\\x92m 100 sure that my cause of death someday will be suicide i plan to kill myself in 3 days sliting my wrists in a bathtub i cant do this anymore i cant handle myself anymore every day ive been thinking of killing myself ive cut myself nearly every day a hotline operator had to talk me out of overdosing if i dont go im probably going to die goodbye until i get out can i tell my therapist that i tried to kill myself for the fourth time without being locked up please i just need a gun need one to get me out of this mf hellhole no one needs me in their life anyways i hate it here and i aint waiting around for another few years to legally get one so please can someone sell me their gun or help me get one i am like kinda desperate i dont understand why my suicidal thoughts have accelerated so much i am 20 years old ive been dating my girlfriend for over a year but my mother only found out about it at the beginning of this year my father accidentally saw me fucking my girlfriend and told my mother about it they didnt talk to me for a few days a week later he hung himself because im gay my mother keeps telling me that im the reason he killed himself i cant believe i killed him i want to hang myself next week id love any advice you can give me i would rather kill myself on the spot then spend a second talking to someone like a therapist and everyone who thinks therapy helps or helped them are lying brainwashed or never really had a mental illness i don\\x92t care to create one either there\\x92s no inherent purpose to life i used to read philosophy absurdism existentialism nietzche i found it interesting some of my beliefs had been written but at the same time i know i just have no reason to live i\\x92m tired i feel absolutely nothing yeah i\\x92m completely emotionally void and idk what to do about it other than want to die i was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 so there\\x92s that like i wanna cry but i can\\x92t either i wanna die  but i keep living  why  why  convince me to kill myself i\\x92m high and this sub is insanely depressing lol some people are better off and i am one of them but a pussy if you want to actually help me this is much better than getting generic advise or being told to accept a fast food gig for my whole life feel free 2 comment and disagree and collect your karma lol be thankful all of your brains work dying sounds really nice since being awake and existing is making me feel genuinely sick now i get really angry i hate this world and all the people who act the same im extremely angry everyday because it feels like im the only one that trys to think different from the rest of these sheep i want to die because im surrounded by all these people i plan to suicide tomorrow i have been struggling to live ever since i have cronic back pain i cant even work even thought im very disciplin and responsible its been 3 years since i depress everyday crying everyday i have been trting to suicide for so many time but i scared leaving my love ones but now im prepared im ready tomorow i will do it i don\\x92t know what i need to do i\\x92m so lost  so lost  i don\\x92t know who i am anymore neither do i care about anything which is happening around me  i\\x92m being too needy of my boyfriend because although i have friends i find him to be my go to person and it\\x92s getting too much for him too cause he\\x92s facing his own issues  i don\\x92t know what i should do  where i should go and with all this time and no motivation whatsoever to do anything i just don\\x92t know any longer  i\\x92m showing people my state cause at this point i can\\x92t even hide it and it kills me to know that family around me is getting to know i\\x92m not okay  i wanna be the old me again but i don\\x92t even know her or anything now  lost  i cant take the pain anymore its so hard to explain what the pain feels like to someone but its extremely unbearable not even the fucking alcohol that used to help helps now nothing helps the worst of it all is that i know damn well its all my fault just 24 hours back everything was fine not great or whatever but i was keeping it together i then became acting like a jealous piece of shit and now i just fucking it up more and more i just cant stand this anymore i want it to stop forever i want to rest finally hopefully they don\\x92t find my body bye\\n it wont be tonight or next week or the week after but ive long feared my life ends in suicide my life is falling apart and im out of options except for suicide i\\x92m feeling really depressed and lonely and really could use a friend to talk to i feel like sobbing and hurting myself i\\x92m contemplating suicide and hanging myself i\\x92m thinking of trying it from a pulley system thanks goodbye if i don\\x92t get back in time someone please help me i feel so suicidal and i don\\x92t know what to do seriously i try to but they just tell me to reach out when i do most people jusr ghost me whats the point maybe i should just kill myself i just want to claw my face off im fucking tired of everything yup i\\x92m fucking killing myself downing some pills don\\x92t know if it\\x92ll work or not i hope it does i\\x92m a fucking degenerate i should be dead no one would care enough to put me into therapy i\\x92ll be out of their lives soon enough fukc me what a shit life i think ill hang myself tomorrow\\x85 i cant take it struggling with staying stable emotionally and getting a job going to eventually kill myself if nothing changes this may sound strange but im not sure if im trying to kill myself like i have multiple plans just tried to hamg myself to know if it would be to painful but i dont know it that counts as actively trying to kill myself ive been 4 months clean for self harm and i just wanna do it so bad i just dont know if i should call the suicide hotline or just keeo trying to hang myself hey i\\x92ve been doing some thinking and i come to the conclusion that i want to die but i don\\x92t want to do it alone does anyone else wanna die too when i was 1112 years old i took a big knife and cut my neck big cut to sadly i lived and i\\x92ve now tried to kill myself 21 times and it\\x92s always on my mind mainly recently i found an old \\x93journal\\x94 of mine basically just suicide notes but now i deal with a big scar and a fucked up voice i needed this off my chest thanks for listening what amount of suicidal thoughts are normal i probably will kill myself i have depression with psychotic symptoms and autism with mentally abusive parents but humor helps me hide my pain lmfaaoooooooooooo i am going to end it all i tried to move out today 18 and it failed now my life is going to be eternally fucked and ive lost my boyfriend of which i planned on marrying because he stood up to my mother i cant

i\\x92m an 18 year old female i ruin everything i\\x92m rude to people who just want to help me because i\\x92m just always filled up with anger happy moments in my life going on vacation last summer prom my 18th birthday a few weeks ago we\\x92re all terrible because i was just sad for no reason it feels like nothing is worth it and all i do is let everyone down i have no motivation to do anything after high school i just want to die bye i\\x92ll be dead when you read this wish me luck i can\\x92t take it i\\x92m a stitched pile of flesh barely capable of existing all i can think of is clawing myself to pieces and tearing skin and tendons apart my thoughts consist almost entirely of cleaving my hands off or scraping my eye out of its socket my dreams involve vomiting ribs and intestines and all i want to do is buy a gun to finish the job i can\\x92t even look at myself in the mirror without losing focus i can\\x92t be around my friends anymore because i\\x92m constantly reminded how scrapped together i am death would be a mercy less than 2 hours before i make the jump everything i did today has been my last and my heart is beating so fast only on the verge of death do i feel like life has meaning its no one fault but mine im ready thank you i just want to die ive been suicidal since i was 8 and idrk how i pulled thru my family says im selfish well i wish i was selfish for once and end this shit they call life the only reason im still here is because of my cousin and little sisters also the promise i made so long ago why did she leave me then she tells me not to the same ne gayzzzzzz i have been clear for about 2 months but rlly am thinking of it again two idiots had sex years ago and i have to live in this fucking world and suffer every single day until i die and for what why did they even do this because of some stupid whim they brought me to this world and im supposed to be thankful that they did so the only reason im still here is that im too scared to kill myself i hate physical pain even after living with it every day thanks to some fucking chronic illnesses i cant forgive my parents for bringing me to life such a selfish thing to do i really wanna shoot myself if i tell anyone about my suicidal thoughts they\\x92ll just send me back to a psychiatric hospital so i have to bottle them up or they\\x92ll just send me somewhere that won\\x92t even help me and my parents think killing yourself is selfish and they don\\x92t understand depression at all i just want to die really i have no reason at all to be alive my parents just argue 247 im completlly failing school i lost all my friends i have clinical depression i need advice should i kill myself i still wanna die but im learning to keep it to myself again nobody wants to hear it they all got their own shit going on its easier to just shove it all down again im finding new ways to it gets easier every day and i feel less human every day i guess its not at all sustainable but whateverright now its all i have i want to die it\\x92s too suffocating to keep living i just want to feel nothing cause all i do is cry i\\x92ve already done treatment and i\\x92m telling you it didn\\x92t work for me i\\x92m not meant to be happy i can\\x92t wait for death to come please someone manifest a nice death for me so i don\\x92t have to do it myself ive always had a love for death since i was younger and the concept of death comforts me the idea of suicide seems cute and appealing to me am i fucked up for liking photos of peoples suicide and wanting it to be me either way i really want to commit suicide i have it planned out completely including a route i know there are many people that love me but i dont care i dont care about anything i attempted suicide on saturday but before then i made sure to delete all social media apps and also all my pictures on my phone besides school notes my school notes are just pictures because i don\\x92t have the motivation to write shit down i made sure to save them and they were saved but now 2 days later theyre gone is this what i fucking get for trying to kill myself now i\\x92m still alive in this bullshit and i will fail the school year now thanks universe i just wanna be dead its my birthday today and i want to die more than ever no reason to live life is meaningless no one cares i have no one ive always been treated like dirt so i kind of expected this no matter how much i care about others its never reciprocated ill be setting another suicide date soon probably i dont feel pain at the idea like i used to its just natural and kind of funny in my case i think it would be hilarious to die im thinking of ending my life soon hello i think about suicidebecause i have credits and debts i just need someonewho can loan me money its real in this worl or i just need to do it my life is over i failed at the simplest dye recipe for my dyer profession projects and everyone hates me for being ugly im ending it all tonight\\n i am suicidal i have been for almost the past year and i\\x92m planning on doing it in a couple months i\\x92ve gotten pretty good at hiding my depression lately but i just sort of wish i could talk to someone about it i have all these thoughts going around in my mind and i kind of just want to vent them all to someone but it\\x92s hard because i know if i tell anyone they will try to make me get help or try to stop me from doing it no matter how hard i try i fail people get advantage from me i don\\x92t do anything right i want to get killed as soon as possible i won\\x92t be able to do anything right i think i might kill myself tonight i\\x92m just tired of this feeling i want it to end this is horrible i want out i really dont like any of this fuck my life let me out please im just tired this is the only place where i feel like i can say anything and no one can judge me so here i go im planning to kill myself  tonight im just waiting for my parents to go to bed someone please kill me i don\\x92t want to be here any longer i always fuck things up im just killing myself i cant ever do anything right im done fucking done im weird i dont deserve to live i make people uncomfortable im just done goodbye i will neck myself i cant take it anymore i tired of living where the only people care about is some fucking grades and about how i look bullshit that does not matter always being judge for playing video games my parents take things that make me happy in hopes of me changing people treat like shit then cry when you kill yourself i have been mentally broken to the point its all i remember its got to the point where i snapped at school said just wanted to kill myself and some bitch laughed and stood up walked to desk pushed her out of her seat grabbed that bitches hair slammed her head on the floor over and over i kicked her again and again the teacher could not stop me at that point because i was so pissed off i would attack her as well i was suspended when i came back she started her shit again when i was going back home i kicked harder and slammed harder when i was done i told her that if i had to do that again i would stab her until i killed her then she stopped my parents put me in a mental hospital i still want to kill myself i have spite for everybody around me making sure i kill myself tonight i got everything i need right now it\\x92s just a matter of time feeling so suicidali dont know how much more i can fight it im so broken i want to take my own life if someone could tell me a way that i could do it that is quick and if possible painless ill be verey gratefull someone please help me find a way to go in peace i want to kill myself everyday but i am afraid i will never have the courage to do it and will be doomed to live in this abomination of a body for the rest of my life\\n i kinda wish my family didnt love me so i could kill myself in peace i find myself googling i just want to kill myself pretty much every day i bet if i killed myself in my apartment i could easily go about a month before anyone realized my wife committed suicide i want to follow her whenever things get shitty i just think about killing myself and it makes me feel better it\\x92s pissing me off that i can\\x92t have a conversation with anyone about suicide without them thinking i\\x92m going to immediately kill myself i regret not having attempted to kill myself when i had the chance i feel so trapped now i really don\\x92t know what to do anymore i have no one to live for and i cant live for myself the only thing i want is to die\\n\\n i think the only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact i do not like pain i just wanna peacefully disappear in my sleep or get randomly abducted by aliens i dont want people to remember who they think i am i just wanna vanish without a trace ive fucked up so much already i wish i was allowed to commit suicide i wish i fucking die in my sleep i fucked up everything i ruin everything i touch i cannot believe how undeniably hard it is to kill yourself ive tried with guns and hanging multiple times throughout my life and im amazed how i can never go through with it even with every reason to do so the fear and regret of the action is powerful i guess im mostly afraid of living after the gunshot horrible agonizing pain still being alive possible vegetable status and then my gun taken away from me which means i can never try again it saddens me i wish there was a legal painless peaceful way to go out that didnt require jumping over many hoops for many years to get to no nigga i literally want to kill myself but i\\x92m too pussy and don\\x92t want it to hurt the thought of killing myself gives me comfort knowing that i won\\x92t be here for much longer that it\\x92s a matter of if not when i commit suicide the fact that when it\\x92s done i won\\x92t be in pain anymore knowing that there\\x92s nothing on the other side to worry about no negativity no pain nothing all of it comforts me i can\\x92t wait to die i think about killing myself everyday hopefully it won\\x92t be that much longer inm writing this as i die just took alot of pills im so sorry to my family that i wasnt strong enough im sorry to my fiance that i could make it till the wedding i send most of my money to my mother and fold my work i will not be coming in tomorrow im fell like im might ye at peace may god forgive me think i will use a knife to finish i lost my best friend she told me she cant take my depression like i ask for this fuck her im over trying to open myself up to people and then stepping on me when i kill myself they will all be sorry at least i would be at peace fuck people can anyone spare time to talk i know its a long shot but i have nobody to talk to and no friends and i just need to get a few things off my mind thats driving me crazy i attempted suicide and almost succeeded a week ago and i feel so helpless and weak as a person  ive always felt this way but the last 6 months have been a lot worse thank you the only time i can get away from being depressed and suicidal is when im sleeping i just wish i could sleep forever being awake existing thinking remembering eating it just brings me agony i was supposed to kill myself today but i couldnt go through with it im in so much pain right now i tried to hang myself yesterday i deleted everything in my mobile and laptopi wrote a note but when i wanted to hang myselfi couldnt i feel empty in the days my thoughts are fucked up in the nights im getting fucked up nightmares whenever i wake up im automatically feeling the need to kill myself yesterday it got real the strings of all the thoughts when i put the rope on necki just couldnt im worried about my mom and my dogs but i just cant continue living this life wish i could get a gun so that itll all go away in a bang i have no one im afraid of the future only way i could escape this miserable life is death never realized how hard it is once i put the rope around my necki fucked my career i fucked up life at this point everything seems pointless i attempted suicide last night i drank one bottle of vodka and took 20 pills of valproate i told my parents and they made me throw up the pills i feel like such a failure i shouldnt have told them i was going to drink more alcohol and go to sleep hoping id get respiratory failure and then die i was also going to take all my benzos but my father hides them because of another suicide attempt i had a few years ago i feel helpless hopeless empty lonely i really wish id never wake up again i hate how conflicted i feel on one hand i wanna just take my life and on the other hand i feel anxious to because i don\\x92t wanna hurt everyone in my life but the trauma of how i was emotionally and physically abused as a child just keeps coming up and the ptsd from it hurts so bad i just feel like i\\x92ll never escape i just wanna end it so bad but don\\x92t wanna hurt my very little friends i have left but my brain hurts so bad and i just want it to stop i\\x92m 13 and i got into an argument with my parents after my mom punished me i went upstairs and whispered that i was just going to end up like my friend who committed suicide this year my mom heard and she at first thought that i was just making threats i explained to her my problems and she went outside she was calling my doctor with tears in her eyes i love my mom to death and i feel terrible for making her feel this way i don\\x92t want her to cry i really don\\x92t what do i do girlfriend of 4 years my first and only just broke up with me because im too depressed thanks that helped a lot now i want to kill myself more than ever and cant do it because otherwise shell feel guilty and she doesnt deserve it shes a good person the best ive ever met i am the one whos fucked up why was i even born into this hell also mt brother killed himself during our relationship at least i had him before dont know if i can hold it for too long i am so incredibly sad and depressed i just dont see another way out then jumping off a ledge to be honest i didnt want to die but now i want it more than anything i feel like a shit human being because they only thing i can do is make people tired of me because my constant sadness i just want someone to see me and my problems and just help me i need advice a friend just told me he is going to kill himself today we met and try to talk so i can understand him but i couldnt help i tried to offer him a session with a specialist and he denied it he is really set on the idea ive tried to talk about all the good things but he doesnt care i left him taking a cab to his apartment where he wants to die life has and will always suck i cant wait to die so why wait its constant painnot even pain its agony its pain that i cant describe its too much and when i say too much i truly mean it i dont have access to a gun but i have a few razor blades if anyone has any better idea please tell me i hope i go to hell because thats where low life lazy people like me go what is the fastest painless way to die please ik you will say dont do it or smthg but im fr in a rush help i wanted to at least clean my room and write few suicide notes but do i even care anymore ill just do it silently and stop suffering i dont wanna die but i feel like theres no other options i want to rest i dont understand how people can live and survive without ever thinking of suicide what is it about life that they enjoy so much are they happy or do they simply not think about whether theyre happy yesterday my mom cried in my arms and begged me not to kill myself i wanted to promise her that i wouldnt but i couldnt i just want to be gone to stop thinking to stop existing to rest what r good ways of suiciding dont write helpful shit i wanna end it today my best friend killed herself a few months ago and i haven\\x92t been the same i\\x92m always sad and i just don\\x92t see any better days coming anymore this is my 5th suicide iv had to go through and i\\x92m only 22 i\\x92m tired of all the hurt i go through and all the loneliness i\\x92m exhausted all i want is a hole in a wall somewhere i dont want an apartment or house or anything i want a hole in a wall and a secret room so i can come and go at night or really any time i dont want to be seen i want to be invisible i dont want anyone to know my name i want it to be like i was never alive i want everyone to forget i was ever alive before i die i want everyone to hate me i fucking hate everyone the only practical way to kill everyone in the world is to kill one self i hate the idea that after i die anyone else will still be living my gpa is terrible and i want to kill myself long story short i calculated my gpa calculated what it would be if i did well next year and its a fucking 30 im in sophomore year of high school right now and the pandemic started when i was in freshman year and after that my grades dropped so much that at some point i was failing everything i really thought id turned things around and gotten my grades up but apparently the damage is irreversible i looked it up and even if i do well on the sats and acts i wont get into any good colleges im a failure both my parents and my older sister and pretty much every adult relative on my dads side went to amazing colleges and ill probably be the only one to go to community college i hate myself im probably going to go to a bridge and jump off i already tried overdosing a while ago and i didnt even take enough to throw up life isnt fair im tired of feeling powerless ive got such a lack of control of everything around me that i find it too overwhelming i just need to accept the fact that im worthless and insignificant ill never have any power ill never be completely satisfied with my life and the way things are death would be a sweet release to escape the overwhelming and harsh realities of life its not for me anymore looking at everything wondering how you could use it to kill yourself is so tiring anyone else get this no matter if its a building a lake whatever its so tiring and frustrating i tried killing myself but failed i stopped taking care of myself being a teenage girl sucks ive stopped exercising doing my homework seeing my friends and doing other things i liked i barely shower and i stopped tracking my period daddy doesnt care about me no one does i feel worthless and stuck i want to end it but i am not allowed to i want to die simple as that but i cant die knowing i will destroy my family with my death but i cant live without my partner either i just want to follow her into the grave she took her own life so why shouldnt i but i cant do to my family what she did to me god i want to die but i want live too on the contrary i feel like i am forced to live i wanna kill myself my aunt died my dad just got diagnosed with cancer and my mom found out im failing my classes  i dont know if i can do another year today is my 25th but i dont know if i have any have what it takes to go another year ive been fighting my demons and trauma for over 15 years and i dont think i can keep it up i just wanna go to sleep forever it hurts to keeps fighting i wish to end my life today because im in a constant depression and loneliness i keep having panic attacks and i have no loved ones to reach out other than my mom my other family members hates me for no reason i dont know what to do at this point\\x85 i keep praying to god than getting a panic attack because of it  im in a constant torture only thing i fear is not being able to successfully kill myself i accept that my life is shit and probably is not going to get better physical health issues as long as i can die i keep delaying my death but\\x85 not because i wanna keep living im just afraid of death i didnt put all that commitment in nothing just because i thought i will die anyway one day ill have the courage to kill myself and everything else wont matter anymore just i totally dont have the courage to do so i hate my life but im too scared to die i pray my sufferings will end but nobody seems to care im alone im scared and i feel so so bad could someone say something please it doesnt matter what i just need something to feel real i know this isnt a helpline i dont know if i could bear saying this out loud i just need a connection to feel something other than this please i am so lonely i think of committing suicide everyday i\\x92ve never felt this lonely in my life this pandemic has shown me that i truly have no real friends and it\\x92s killing me inside it\\x92s like i knew it before but this is just confirming it being lonely is one of the worst feelings in the world not only that but i am so worthless i don\\x92t do anything with my life i\\x92m only 18 i should have friends and experience many things right now but i have nothing absolutely nothing i keep crying myself to sleep because there\\x92s no one there for me why can\\x92t i just die i don\\x92t have a purpose and i\\x92m sure no one would care i\\x92m just so tired i\\x92m sorry im thinking of ending it all my girlfriend left me i cant bare the pain my head is in pain i have ocd i keep having unwanted thoughts about her ther is this pain in my chest and head i cannot distract myself im broke i cant do anything idk i want to kill myself i cant take it anymore plz idk what to do idk what i should do im just tired i aint suicidal depressed or bored either mostly tired tired of waking up everything tired of living i hate everything literally its almost like i cant feel anything but hate towards everything lifes crap can i finally kill myself successfully i\\x91m thinking about ending it a lot but i\\x91m too much of a coward to actually do it a painless instant death right now hell yes i would do it if i had an easy accessible way for cowards with 100 success rate bet me in i don\\x91t see a reason to be alive there is no happy future i see myself in nothing i want no kids house wife success in my job like nothing i don\\x91t want to see the world beautiful things which may be beautiful to others i see it i see a sunset but i just cant feel it i could say \\x84wow what a beautiful sunset\\x93  i\\x91m unable to believe my own words but i know life is a gift and valuable treasure  but i don\\x92t want it i didn\\x92t ask to be here i\\x91m not made for this shit i simply deserve death its all my fault im just an useless bad

and hoped i wouldnt wake up but then i did i dont know how to talk to anyone about what happened i dont want to say the words to anyone for fear of making it more real i mean how do you say to your friends and family that you tried to kill yourself without them even noticing how will they trust me again i\\x92d rather have a terminal illness at least then i know when i will die no one gives a rats ass about suicide unless they want to not feel guilty if i had a nickel every time i had told someone on here that i was depressed and they called me a \\x93troll\\x94 i would literally be a billionaire i\\x92ve said it many times nobody actually cares about you they just pretend i think im going to die soon anyway im not feeling well im always running out of breath my head is swimming and always hurts like if for one second i stop focusing i will pass out and thats it i am not well i have no money no family no love no hope no clean clothes cant shave or shower yet everyone keeps saying i need to live or i have so much to live for then why wont you help me please kill me or help me i cant live like this anymore please kill me 6 months since my last suicide attempt everything just got worse honestly i wish i could give my life to anyone else i try to practice gratitude but i feel like no matter how much good i do i end up back here i can\\x92t even remember the last time i ate i\\x92m constantly confused as to whether something actually happened or not i\\x92m getting nowhere in therapy i can\\x92t afford my bills i am such a waste of a person i don\\x92t have a reason to keep going i don\\x92t want to be me anymore i can\\x92t even write out a long thing about how miserable i am i\\x92m just so tired i can\\x92t do this anymore i\\x92m sorry i recently had a failed suicide attempt i dont think i can live with the shame i scared the people who care about me i even scared myself i was doing insane doses of benzos and dont remember much about what happened it was very spontaneous and i wasnt lucid and sober at all when i did this i think i fried my brain or something i dont feel like myself anymore now ive made a huge mess and just want to dig myself down in a hole the guilt and shame is unreal i dont think i can recover and take back my life after this im really scared now most painless method been looking for a way out for quite some time nothing is going ok in my life and it\\x92s been this way for years looking for a painless method as i have a low pain tolerance im still a kid so i can\\x92t just go to the pharmacy and buy anything so i overdosed and i feel calm i\\x92m just waiting til death takes me i\\x92m a bit sad that i\\x92ll have to die alone but it\\x92s okay at least soon i\\x92ll be free my close relative has just hung himself i have no words i\\x92m devastated he was my age only a year older 19 years old it hurts so much i am sick by the fact that parents do not pay attention to the pain of their children at all teenagers are super super vulnerable they only see it when its too late i\\x92m furious as a person who has had suicidal attempts herself and after that people will say that mental disorders don\\x92t mean anything i have lived with borderline personality disorder and complex ptsd all my conscious life ive had suicide attempts and now im sobbing and understand i dont want to be one of those people no matter how difficult and painful it is i dont want to leave this world so early through all my pain i try to see at least some rays of light in this world sometimes i lose my faith i feel his pain very strongly to everyone who\\x92s currently reading this please dont leave this world please move on your pain matters ask for help whoever you are i love you and you are important   i think i\\x92m ready i\\x92m getting drunk and i\\x92ve just been sitting here looking at my gun and i think it\\x92s finally time i\\x92m gonna finish this bottle then get through with this shit life i lost everything and everyone i loved i just see no fuckin point i want to fuckin die writing down all my online passwords for my family before i commit suicide i hate myself so mucb im a bad person my mental illness makes me intolerable and toxic and everyone leaves me my ex left me and i miss him so much he was the last person i could open up to and hes gone now and im not okay i have no one i m going insane suffering alone i cant do it anymore none of this matters i am speeding up natures course of action and will be gone within 5 mins of this post going up im sorry to all those i leave behind but i cant continue another day i\\x92m having a really hard time in life and i can\\x92t stop fantasizing about killing myself i attempted suicide in the past through overdose it didn\\x92t kill me rather caused neurological damage that impaired the motor skills in my hands i had to reteach myself how to do everything with my hands i had moved past all of that and was trying to pick up the pieces and learn to appreciate being alive my mental health started improving i got a good job picked out a healthy partner my life should be great right now then last july my grandmother who was my best friend fell and hit her head she was resuscitated despite her dni and spent two days as a total vegetable before dying right after this i also had an onset of a chronic pain condition before my sickness started i was already dealing with pain from my endometriosis and the adhesions binding my organs for the last 9 months i\\x92ve been seeing doctors and no one has helped me i stay between 810 on the pain scale all day long every day  and all night since it keeps me up after almost a year nonstop pain it doesn\\x92t matter how much therapy or support i have i just want out of this pain and i can\\x92t stop obsessively thinking about how to do it properly with no errors as i know firsthand what it\\x92s like to fuck up a suicide attempt and be left damaged at this point the fear of waking up in the hospital in even more pain is what keeps me from killing myself by a thin hair but every day i get closer to the edge my family and therapist see this they are trying so hard to help me i am trying so hard to help myself nothing is working and i am in pure agony both mental and especially physical i feel as if i was born to suffer i survived a very traumatic childhood years of abuse and severe mental illness to be struck down with genetic diseases before the age of 21 i feel pathetic and like i\\x92m dying inside in a way i\\x92ve never experienced before i am going to finally do it its almost time when everyone goes to bed i have a bunch of tylenol waiting for me i am terrified hopefully its not too painful it will all be over soon  goodbye i just want to end the pain and laid to rest at this point im sick of the crying and panic attacks i never asked to be born i fucked over my parents life since they became parents so young i want to die but im to scared to do it i wrote a suicide note and idk why the other night i went to bed pretty early and i randomly woke up at 4am and started getting such intrusive thoughts of what i would say if i ever committed suicide and left a note right then and there i got my journal and i wrote out my note before doing that and getting that random thought i didn\\x92t consider myself suicidal but i\\x92m not so sure now the things that popped into my mind just seemed so justified to me and made suicide actually sound like an option i don\\x92t have any actual suicide plans but i do know what i would say in a note and i know how i would do it and those thoughts alone terrify me i don\\x92t mean any form of encouragement by this at all i was just manic and i am now inherently worried i took 6 500mg paracetamol tablets and 2 200mg ibuprofen tablets anyone have an idea on how dangerous this is do i need to throw up  help please i am actually unattractive the society decided that i am ugly since my birth and that no one will ever like me as a friend or as a lover i will try to commit suicide again inside i am so dead that outside has to die too i hate everything i just wanna die  i hate everything  everybody is stupid why dont people use their brains  i hope i die soon idc if my soul burn in hell at least i dont have to deal with humansi hate waking up  everyday i is pain for me i dont want help i dont rlly see a reason to live i dont want to live but sadly i still kinda care about my life like i cant list anything that would give me reason to live i mean i love my parents i love my friends but i just dont care i just dont want to live i need a way out i need a painless way of getting out of this world im so tired please ive mixed three times my xanax dose with two times my muscle

accomplished i can\\x92t and won\\x92t imagine to keep living with this stupid depression anymore all of my teen life was nothing but sadness at suicidal attempt failures\\x85 i burnt all friendships and slowly distancing myself from family i feel alone not scared of death i feel at peace with the idea of dying i\\x92m going to die\\x85i can guarantee my safety till after graduation really fucking tired of having to deal with depression alone really fucking tired thinking about it already a few pills in ive toyed with the thought of suicide for a while and now is the perfect time seeing as my parents left for vacation and nobody will be around to stop me im taking vicodin and xanax feel pretty good rn and am still with it but i have all these pills in front of me so tempting to take them all and just end it my future is hopeless lost my job back in april of 2020 which was the best job id ever had and it threw me into a deep depression ended up calling a suicide hotline big mistake and was involuntarily committed to a psych unit and made to take meds that my insurance didnt cover i still owe around 1000 for the bottle of latuda which is a shit drug and i wish i could sell to someone and help pay for it im putting in hundreds of applications a week but no luck and my unemployment is out im probably gonna swallow all these pills my love interest isnt texting back much anymore probably found someone else nobody will ever love me for me and if i keep on living ill just be a miserable wage slave thats given up on any form of a dream peace out yall if you hear from me in the morning so be it but if i dont wake up i guess thats that they just keep trying to make me do it youre gonna kill yourself ok whatever no you arent its not that bad id ask wheres a razor blade i wanna kill myself and they say check the draw under the sink it should be there they push me down the stairs and my head into the walls im not allowed to get treatment they watch me try to kill myself give me things im deathly allergic to to snort so i can die they just bought me a new razor bladebox opener for it they put me in triggering ptsd and eds situations and never allow me to have my coping mechanisms i tried to kill myself i do every day i did 10 minutes ago i wanted it to work but we couldnt find that goddamn fucking razor blade that we all searched for 30 minutes ago the kitchen knife was too dullin the morning itll be see you arent dead fake bitch i wish i had gotten that abortionyeah i wish you did too i\\x92ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts daily for nearly 6 years now therapy doesn\\x92t help everyone in my life is temporary i keep becoming more of a fuck up day by day no matter how hard i try i always fuck up i am a waste of oxygen i haven\\x92t killed myself yet but i\\x92ve already decided it is my fate suicide is how i am going to die it won\\x92t be illness old age or a car accident it will be from a cocktail of drugs and alcohol and a bullet to the brain nothing will change my fucking mind wanna just do it thinking i\\x92m going to do it finally seriously reached a point i can\\x92t deal with everything anymore cant find happiness im a hypocrite im ungrateful im a hurricane in everyones lives im paranoid im indecisive im lonely im good at helping others but i cant seem to make myself or keep myself happy i had a good thing going with an angel of a woman i fucked that up because of my selfishness i am bipolar i am never happy i cant do this anymore theres nothing left for me ill finish my art and end it im tired of this why cant i enjoy anything why am i always so ungrateful for everything i have family and friends that love me but i feel so alone i dont deserve their love i wish i was a fucking ghost i dont care about the pain anymore i used to fear the pain that would come when i would kill myself it always led me to stop i dont care if it hurts i can endure a couple hours before i end it i just want permission to end it im horrible and awful and terrible i might try self mutilation after years of being clean\\x85 i need to feel anything but what im feeling i want to call a hospital but i cant afford it so i think im better off dead so far ive tried prozac made me want to kill myself more took another type too lazy to find the name for it didnt change me one bit took serotonin pills just made me feel like the medication is merely making me look happy not mentally they have now made be take 2 of my current depression pills not serotonin one and i feel the same which is complete shit i feel so tired i come from an abusive household mentally and physically my entire life i\\x92ve done everything i can to leave their house and start a better one of my own i\\x92ve coped with chronic anxiety and depression while making my way through school and got accepted into a college only to find out i needed one more class to transfer causing a possible effect of my acceptance there\\x92s a lot of filler to this story but i\\x92ve dealt with so much stuff and i\\x92m so tired i feel exhausted i haven\\x92t gotten suicidal thoughts in a long time and i don\\x92t know why but i feel done i felt like i was just finally able to be free and happy but even if i do go to college im starting to believe that that\\x92s something i\\x92m never going to feel whenever i fall in love with someone and shit goes sideways i literally want to kill myself im currently in treatment and fell for someone here which is already bad and i want to cut so bad but i dont have anything and im so fucking tired of repeating this cycle i feel so stupid and so dramatic why do i want to die just because shit falls through with someone i love why am i so stupid im disgusting im horrible and gross and i need to die i hate myself so much i wish i could jump off a cliff i wanna this misery over i cant take life anymore its just too much i cant even sleep im such a failure i feel like killing myself my whole body aches im just a giant burden and bette roff dead im so sick of life i cant take much more help   i\\x92ve been so married to the idea i\\x92d kill myself one day that i can\\x92t live without it they want to take it away from me to make me healthy but i don\\x92t want that i don\\x92t want to live i actively do not want to enjoy my life i want it to be over i\\x92m tired i\\x92m bored and i\\x92m fucking angry i don\\x92t want to cope i cannot i am not built for that they keep giving me hope and snatching it from me and i don\\x92t want it any more i don\\x92t want hope or it will get better i want everyone to stop lying to me everyone blames other people for everything maybe if people didnt blame other people for everything i wouldnt be so angry and think about killing other people and then killing myself found a way to hang myself im really nervous cuz i never really had an actual way to kill myself before that would 100 work last time i tried i was gonna jump into the lake in the middle of winter but the police got to me and an ambulance took me to the children\\x92s hospital before i could do it now though im locked up in my room with a dog leash hung around my bedframe i have it in a way so i can die sitting like how people tie belts around doorknobs i tried doing it and it worked really really fast it took only like 5 seconds and i was blacking out a little and i panicked and unbuckled the collar as fast as i could if i could tie away my hands then next time i try i won\\x92t be able to unbuckle it im planning on doing it tonight after i pick a nice song and write a good enough note the responses from the only 3 people ive trusted in years to let know i was suicidal laughing shut the fuck uphave a little bit more respect for yourself when i was 1213 i had lot of energy and passion i was just a little kid having fun like many others and i was a bit hyped about adult life i\\x92m committing suicide in a few hours i always knew it would come to this i was chronically ill then homeless now i\\x92m going to kill myself cause there\\x92s no way out and earth is populated by evil devils i\\x92m going to jump and have no one to say goodbye too i have no friend or love i\\x92m going to die tonight goodbye does anyone else just wish they could purposely fail a suicide attempt just to get people to care and hear you for once it seems like nobody truly gives a shit until you kill yourself or try to kill yourself fuck i spend more time planning my death than my life i find it hilarious in a fucked up way i just dont want to be here making plans for the future i mixed 2 chill pills and im already yawning like mofo when im ready i will take more i think having to pull my mom down as she tried to hang herself fucked me up really badly and affected my suicidality i havent told anyone but the people that witnessed it and the ems and firefighters that came when i called 911 its been almost 2 years now but i dont think ill ever be the same nobody cares  not even the fucking people here on reddit go scroll i\\x91m just some random internet dude who\\x91s gonna kill himself lol last year in an attempt of taking my life away i hid somewhere to overdose the damage to my body the burn it felt like heaven and for once i was happy happy that i would never have to endure another day happy because i would no longer feel pain nor sadness i was about to die and i was so happy about it but someone found me did what they had to do and i survived i dont think about killing myself as often as i used to but i miss the feeling of overdose it genuinely felt amazing no i wont tell you what drugs i used should i just kill my bully then kill myself took my fucking own family away from me treated me like shit for weeks and took away my only good friend everyone will just listen to him every word he says nobody will believe me he just sucks the dick of everyone more popular than him and he gets his way stomp that fuckers head into the ground then just shoot myself atleast he\\x92ll be going down and rotting into hell with me like he fucking should there\\x92s no hope for me i\\x92ve never posted here before my life is so pointless and my childhood was so badmy dad and stepmum were abusive and my mum totally neglected mei have suspected autism and adhd i also have cptsd i don\\x92t have my friends that i can rely on and i am really alone i feel like there is no hope for me and i should just give up now i don\\x92t have the strength to even eat anymore i pray to god every night that i die i\\x92m an atheist that\\x92s how

currently no job with a baby on the way im sure everyone thinks im a bum i feel like a loser my future is dim in fact i dont see me having a future at all im done holding on im done praying for better days i want the pain and anguish to end now going to kill myself someday because of how unattractive i am i am unattractive thats what the society and beauty standards say people only judge about looks i think i will end my life this week ive been dealing with depression for the past year and a half my parents dont take it seriously and i just feel so alone please dont say that i am loved and that people care about me nobody has ever cared about me i promise im invisible i talk and everyone just ignores me like im not there my feelings are never important or valid to anyone else my \\x93 mother \\x93 is mentally and has been physically abusive toward me before and all my parents do is complain about what im doing wrong and complain that im not like my sister im not 18 so its not like i could just move out ive always had this lame plan to graduate high school and then leave off to college legally change my name and never talk to my parents again however waiting another year to graduate is not a part of my plans anymore im tired and exhausted i wish i could explain how tired i am mentally and physically i dont remember what it feels like to be happy anymore at this point i dont even know if i believe in happiness anyways i plan on killing myself this week today was a really bad day for me and i almost ended it all today i didn\\x92t go through with it however i wrote my suicide note today im not sure if ill leave it behind once i go i might just leave with no explanation some things are better left unsaid if you read this whole thing thank you and goodbye i have been depressed for a year and haven\\x92t talked to anyone in almost a year and half i just want someone to talk to before i die i just want to say my side of the story i\\x92m going to end it i can\\x92t do this anymore i keep repeating the same pathetic loop of feeling sad desperate angry and then feeling nothing at all i keep holding on to people who hurt me wishing for a clear cut to  find closure i\\x92ll never get i am so tired i am so sick of itand most of all i am so sick of myself and of me being alone and unable to help myself isnt it lovely to be such a failure to have no job or future whatsoever to be too scared to speak your mind to anyone as your like falls apart to not be able to speak like a basic fucking human to feel distant from everyone and wanting more but too scared lazy and dumb to do anything about it to be only known for playing videogames not well but playing them to wish you died in middle school because that was the last time you felt joy without anything in the way to ruin it isnt it fucking lovely one reason to live need just one what is your reason that you want to live for i cant find even one reason to why shouldnt i just kill myself tonight i keep thinking about it non stop i don\\x92t want to be alive university makes me suicidal because i\\x92ve failed so many times i can\\x92t take it anymore clearly i\\x92m not cut out for life i\\x92m in my third year of school and i\\x92ve had to retake classes like 10 times i don\\x92t know how i\\x92m still in this program and i don\\x92t know what i\\x92m doing with myself i\\x92m in so much debt i\\x92m doing so shit i\\x92m not going to get a job in my field even if i get this degree i hate living with my dad i constantly get made fun off and put down and i can\\x92t be myself around him there\\x92s nothing here for me i don\\x92t see a point to keep going my life is over before it even gets to begin someday i will kill myself because i am unattractive i cant take it anymore  im meaningless to everyone ive wrote here before why i feel this way i dont even feel like wallowing in my self pity enough to retype it i just want to be gone i cant take feel happy one day and the next feeling so bad that i dont want to be alive anymore i dont see the point in continuing to live when it all it ever feels like is a constant battle to stay even okay when it feels like im nothing to anyone that im just a drifter in everyones life sometimes i feel tired for help everybody for care about everybody and never have someone to hold my back i feel tired of carry the sky on my shoulders i wish i could not wake up anymore existence is a burden i am exhausted i want to kill myself but not because of my circumstances problems looks money etc i\\x92ve lived a pretty normal life i\\x92ve had good relationships friends and experiences but life is draining i can push through a deal with life\\x92s problems and come out of the end okay  but what then life just feels like a never ending cycle of draining experiences i\\x92m only 22 and i feel like i have already experienced everything i\\x92ve wanted out of life  i don\\x92t desire more money relationships friends etc and i\\x92m slowly losing motivation to chase those things i just want the experience of non experience  is that so bad the more i continue to live life the more it just fatigues me  the idea of not having the capacity to experience things just seems attractive i will probably do it soon and i don\\x92t see a reason why i shouldn\\x92t wanted to buy sn to kill myself but i need more planning to avoid getting found i just wanna die already and it seems like i\\x92ll have to delay my plan by like 23 weeks if i do sn i need at least 4 hours by myself and i can\\x92t do it at night because i could apparently make noise and i don\\x92t even know if i\\x92ll ever have that much time to myself shit is exhausting i cant take it im being destroyed by my mental thoughts i just need to destroy myself i have to the world would be better off without me someone please talk to me i have no one right now and cant fight these thoughts alone just please be female and 16 or above due to bad experiences talking about mental health with men sorry im such a stupid worthless annoying bother please someone kill me please i\\x92m tired i\\x92m really tired life has no point please i am meant to die im so

considering ending it for a while now highschool is just about to finish and i dont even know if im going to graduate i have no plans for the future and no good skills to help me i dont have many

more frequently i dont have any problems i have a few irl friends and im sure theyd be heartbroken if i decide to kick the bucket but i just cant help but feel so worthless everyday is so boring and monotonous even when my family and i went to a spontaneous trip im supposed to feel happy at that but i wasnt i feel like im not doing my best i feel like ive been disappointing others i feel so shameful as i grew older my view in life went from an exciting thing to a miserable existence i dont feel like doing my responsibilities anymore i dont shower anymore i dont exercise anymore but somehow i overeat and my once skinny frame became more pulpychubby i dont have anything to look into and anticipate in my life i feel so hopeless hobbies video games entertainment became so bland to me too my thoughts then turned into how i can try to kill myself just in case i just searched how to tie a noose and i tried it on jumping ropes and it worked really well on my wrist it turned my hand purple for a moment i figured i dont want to go down this path my thoughts will get worse and worse for sure but i really really dont want that to happen please any advice i appreciate it i want to die because im too ugly i cant tell anyone about it because theyll just think that im vain or seeking attention but im really suffering because of my appearance every single day the first and last thing i think about every single day is how much i hate my face it doesnt help either that im surrounded by gorgeous people all the time all i do is cry everyday in my bed feeling like the ugliest person in the world therapy and medication didnt do anything so i just want to disappear already to stop myself i ripped my nail of last night the anxiety was too much usually id cut myself to stop

hire someone yeah i would like to hire someone to kill me buuuut i dont think its that easy sorry if its triggering i can remove it but i really want to\\x85 how can i end my life how to end it in the least painful way is there really a possibility that wont hurt me so much im scared but i dont think theres another option for me please just answer my question i was seriously thinking about killing myself friday i ended up just playing doki doki literature club instead though ive been thinking about death a lot lately i just wanna disappear i dont know anymore i cant do this shit anymore i think im gonna kill myself soon i dont wnat to end my life but it just feels like the only option i cant do anything properly my friend who attempted a few days ago and is luckily okay triggered me i jsut cant do this anymore its too much ill wait to see when ill get my therapist if it wont be soon then i think ill end it i jsut cant live like this i gained weight and that was the last fucking push for me if my friend goes into detail about how she shs and how she attempted shell literally drive me to commit i was getting better but i think i got worse bc of her and idk what to do anymore i just want to end this shit already im using the sub as its literal name keeping myself accountable so the worst i do tonight is sh i have a second out of 3 interview for a dream job tmrw but i just feel so numb my mom just came bursting into my 17f room and called herself a failure and her struggle to make me happy she quit her job so i could have a happy childhood and as a single mom it was hard but she thought it would make me happy but i struggle with low self esteem and image and it\\x92s been like that for a long time recently it\\x92s been getting worse and i completely gave up on school because i didn\\x92t think i was good enough to succeed in life and my gpa is so low i can\\x92t get into community college i\\x92ve been trying to get it up again for the last quarter but now she\\x92s looking at every little thing i do and when i don\\x92t do something she goes on the same tangent about her giving up her job to make me happy but now i\\x92m depressed i just want to die i can\\x92t believe i\\x92m making her feel like this i don\\x92t contribute anything i\\x92ll never be anything good i\\x92m seriously planning on doing it very soon but literally why shouldnt i kill myself why the actual fuck do redditors say shit like the world is gonna end in 2050 and get all passive aggressive when people say that that makes them want to kill themselves what the actual fuck is wrong with those people its like these fucking people dont want you to die quick and easy but slow and miserably at the ripe age of 35 fuck man i wish i never existed scared to commit suicide the only way left is overdosing on stimulants but that can cause so much vomiting hallucinations and so much unpleasant shit i can\\x92t get a gun bc i\\x92m not 18 i don\\x92t live near a bridge or a tall building suffocation is too hard i\\x92d get noticed drowning looks like i\\x92m in a predicament until the day i did there\\x92s no point in life i\\x92ve tried my best to keep going and not lose hope and now i\\x92m exhausted cause nothing\\x92s changing i cant take it in anymore im not even afraid of death i just want to go im tired of this shit there\\x92s no reason to live ive had so many dreams for life and now they all seem too die i don\\x92t know what to do now if i cant be happy why shouldnt i kill myself just a failure so about two weeks ago i took an entire think of sleeping pills i woke up the next day completely out of it and my so called fiancé didn\\x92t even notice i felt like a huge failure and spent the entire day crying at my failed attempt because i can\\x92t even do that right well tonight a little less then a week from my birthday my fiancé tells me he\\x92s moving out because he\\x92s unhappy and his family is telling him to move out and that i may have cheated on him emotionally i can\\x92t can\\x92t a break and i\\x92m ready to just end it all i really hate my life i want do end my life i dont really have a sad lifeim just annoying and immature and most people hate me i believe that my country would be a better place without me but im afraid that there might be afterlife and i might end up suffering foreveri wish death was just eternal sleep i\\x92m failing school have no friends no girlfriend no money and i\\x92m a failure everyday just gets worse and suicide is starting to become a more realistic option i\\x92ve already planned it out for now i just try and drink my pain away but it\\x92s a temporary solution because i have to wake up sober the next day and face reality i feel like i\\x92m on the edge and i\\x92m almost ready to end my life i just want to die why cant i just kill myself ive been considered it every day for probably over half a year even i have a couple of failed attempts in the past why do i keep going i dont see the point im just gonna be stuck in this system of working for the rest of my life i just want to die so why cant i just kill myself for fuckssake what is keeping me here im so tired i dont know what else to do because i can never handle any kind of responsibility like school or work whenever i do those things or even hear about those things i always want to kill myself im always miserable doing any kind of responsibility so why dont i just end it why cant i why do i hate being alive but im too scared to actually commit suicide i feel bad ive gotten actual caring people in my life and have a plan to commit suicide i think its coming to an end again it seems like everytime i start to have a group of friends im happy with something happens and it ends slowly i feel like its slowly going to die from now on i think today was the last day ill ever have with them it happened twice already i dont know whats wrong with me i wish it didnt have to end i really thought i was gonna be happy should i write my suicide notes in advance i\\x92ve decided that if by monday nothing gets better i\\x92ll do it whatever it takes i want to feel the relief might be selfish and i\\x92ll have to think about it some more but i don\\x92t want to continue i want it to stop just make it stop i\\x92ll make sure to write everyone notes and make them know it\\x92s not their fault i want to kill myself but idk how bc im only 13 and i dont have access to much things im so tired of being alive i hate myself for existing everyday i struggle to get out of bed so many things i need to work on if i ever want to feel good and better myself but im so unambitious id rather just waste away in a ditch somewhere all work is exhausting and draining and id much rather die than work on myself im tired of everything i just want to rest forever im so close to doing it im so close to going and buying whatever pills i can at my age 16 and bringing the leftover vodka i have and dying somewhere nice ive tried to od in my room but just got sick and went to bed but i need to do it now i cant do this anymore i genuinely cant i have to go im gonna go soon i hate having feelings i hate that i care about people and that weighs in when i want to give up i hate having emotions and feeling anger jealously loving someone i hate crying because of other people or caring about them i wish i had no emotions whatsoever i hate being a human with emotions and a living one on top of that i hate being alive i hate myself  i hate my current job but i cant quit till i get a new one yet i always get rejections last year i didnt spend time doing personal projects or studying and fk myself up now i totally messed up interviews one called me worthless and slammed the door after i exit i wish i spent my time better last year im too useless and had a mental breakdown mid year till i dont have awareness that i hv to do personal projects now my resume is nothing and no company will recruit me im tired of keeping my job i wish death upon myself but it never happens it sucks because i cant live in pain anymore the solutions to all my problems are dead simple i just wont do them why wont i fix my problems why am i not good enough why wont i get up right now and do 1000 pushups and learn a new language even if there is an answer ill reject it because i want to suffer because i want to get back at myself for ruining my life god i fucking hate myself i want to beat a mirror image of myself to a bloody fucking pulp i deserve the worst pain imaginable theres no excuse for being weak at all theres no excuse for any kind of weakness or imperfection idk if anyone else feels the way i feel i just want to be forgotten about i want people to just leave me behind and go on with their own lives i stopped going to my friends and family when things arent good which is all the time nobody will just let me die and that is what i want so bad people dont understand what i and the rest of you go through death is the only way out i have one of my best friends trying to convince to do inpatient at a hospital did that once before and it didnt work i hated every moment of it they left me in the room by myself a psychiatrist came and talked to me but it was half assed i hated it i just want to die and no one will let me i\\x92m lost i\\x92m twenty years old and feel as if i wasn\\x92t meant for this life everyone around me has goals and dreams and i am just drowning in a lack of direction and hope everything feels pointless part of me feels like life is worth living and i shouldn\\x92t give up while the other wants to give up once and for all i am alone i have tried to get help by telling my family as i live at home but they responded by shaming me and all that did was accelerate and amplify the suicidal thoughts i fought back tho and have been on the verge of suicide for about two mounths now i just want help before i cant wait any longer i really wanna die i dont wanna live pls help i want someone to kill me i can\\x92t kill myself because oh no that would be selfish i have so much to live for no reason to be depressed so i want someone to kill me i\\x92ll be a tragic murder victim instead suicide is the only thing on earth that gets rid of all problems thoughts and feelings forever suicide is just way too good to be true an end for everything sounds way too nicei cant remember the last time i didnt think about suicide for a whole day i just want peace for one day so i can remember the feeling absolutely love when i tell my doctor im feeling intensely suicidal yet i refuse to get any treatment that i get thrown into a shitty ward with no blinds stuck in a single room by myself and the bare minimum of personal freedom i remember why i hate talking about how i feel because i get locked away  fuck this awful system it always happens people get tired of me talking about depression i know they hate having to ask how are you because the answer is almost always bad then again im too stupid to keep answering it with bad when they only want to hear im good i tell my family that im depressed and they change the subject or sigh with annoyance i dont have anyone to talk to and its killing me inside whats the point i know they all would prefer me to succumb to my depression maybe then id stop bitching and moaning about how sad i am the only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fear of messing up knowing me like everything else in my life i would probably fuck up the last thing i need is the embarrassment of being in the hospital with permanent organ damage surrounded by family and friends i barely speak to anymore all forced to pretend like they care about me and my stupid brain i want it all to stop hurting i\\x92m so suicidal and depressed that i fantasize about getting murdered it\\x92s quite disturbing to speak about it but i always make these scenarios of me getting killed because i\\x92m too scared to commit suicide i just want to be done with i want it to be all over is it just me idk i think i should kill myself so iv\\x92e been lying in bed a few hours now trying to think of reasons to keep going i keep trying to convince myself the world isn\\x92t a terrible place theres so much hatred between people greed and everything is about money im just ashamed to be a part of this self destructive human race i don\\x92t get why i would slave away at a shitty job for 50 years in a world with so much negativity in it just to die at the end of it why shouldnt i just kill myself now instead of wasting my time i will kill myself in less than 2 hours suicide feels like my calling in life the same way people feel like they were born for their career choice doctor lawyer musician accountant etc i believe suicide is my ultimate purpose in life i can\\x92t think of anything else that would suit me or even make me happier than if my life were to end abruptly preferably sooner rather than later suicide just feels like the perfect match for me should i write a suicide note for my online friends or should i just give out a vague reason on why theyll never see me again i will be writing a suicide note for friends and family but im not sure about online friends my fear is that ill survive my attempt and then theyll think i was lying when i actually failed the attempt if somebody tells them i survived or if i ever decide to talk to them again im no longer suicidal and it makes me feel worse ive truly come to accept that i dont have the guts to commit suicide but i dont feel better for it i feel worse suicide always gave me comfort an escape from all the problems in life but now i have to deal with all this bullshit on top of that i wasted so many years being suicidal it didnt matter that my grades were dropping i had no job no skills no long term plan because im just gonna kill myself later well i didnt and now im suffering for it fuck my parents for bringing me into this world i think im gonna do it theres no point in life for me i have no friends everyone hates me i hate going to highschool i dont even know my personality im trying to be likeable and act like a normal person but its hard i feel awkward people i know rejecting my friend requests on fb or not following me back on ig is what got me to this point feeling hopeless and realizing no one actually cares about me since im no longer afraid of dying i do wonder to myself what is stopping me from ending my life now i do want to stay around with my family and friends for a month but i am almost dont care to hold off much longer thats the only bad thing about acceptance and feeling numb i could end it all at any time even if i didnt intend to end prematurely i really want to stop existing but haven\\x92t found the most effective way yet i will be too ashamed to stay alive after a failed suicide attempt i tried to die but it didnt work why is dying so hard all i got was a stomach ache that lasted for 7 hours goodbye hey everybody this is my last post tonight i\\x92m going to od on sleeping pills i hope i will have a better after life goodbye i am attempting suicide tomorrow night i will tape a plastic bag over my head it will take me about 10 minutes to pass out and another 10 to die i feel oddly calm right now my heart is beating out of my chest with excitement though wish me luck  i just wanna fuckin g die i cant even conversate well im so stressed out and so awful i hate my life so much i just wanna fucking die why wont it ever stop why is it fucking constant now im not even happy for like 4 hours only

everything is about money im just ashamed to be a part of this self destructive human race i don\\x92t get why i would slave away at a shitty job for 50 years in a world with so much negativity in it

to vent real quick because i dont really have anyone or anywhere else to vent to im depressed and i want to end it all im only 14 but it feels like im only going downhill im so tired and sad all the time i think about ending my life every single day i feel selfish i have a roof over my head food is always on the table and my family is very supportive and caring towards me which only makes me feel worse about my suicidal thoughts i want to end my life so bad but at the same time i cant because i know it would make them sad i just feel like theres nothing for me out there i feel like my existence is meaningless and worthless if i have it hard now and its only going to get worse as i get older whats the point of even trying i dont want to live but i have to for my family i hate it so much and i just want release but i cant and its so painful i hate myself for being such a disappointment why am i not enough my family is broke but they love me too much so they are currently supporting me financially through my gap year while i study for 15 hrs a day just to get into college and i just feel lost at this point ive achieved nothing and i feel like im just wasting their money and time i physically am unable to be productive idk if its because of my shit mental health but my circumstances are literally dragging me down and i dont know how to get out of this state my family cannot survive through another failure i cannot afford to fail and i am so scared because honestly im not sure if ill make it sometimes i feel likenid rather die failed suicide attempt wow so i\\x92m still here came out of hospital and life\\x92s gotten worse cuz i posted my problems on socials so everybody knows my business and keep pestering me like i\\x92m pity case keep getting the same questions again and again but now i just feel bad cuz what i did hurt them and i\\x92m just disgusted with myself but just hate being me and can\\x92t do it again cuz i\\x92ve got everyone checking up on me every 5mins like i\\x92m gonna snap i\\x92m not even getting treated normal they just feel bad for me and just treat me like somethings wrong with me i cant find courage to commit suicide even tho i am in pain i cant fight back against anymore pressure from society family and loneliness broke me into pieces i hate everything that defines me i cant ask for a therapist or for a help cuz my family would refuse to take me there cuz in the place where i live society thinks that if u go to the therapist then u are s crazy mad person who must be locked up in asylum i wanna commit suicide but i cant find courage to do it there is nothing beautiful in my life intrusive suicidal thoughts i have major depression for many years because of the shit happened in my life every time things happen i have this intrusive thoughts that i have to kill myself like theres a voice in my head keeps telling me i have to do it sometimes im not even upset about anything but the voice just keeps telling me that everybody will be happier if i do it i have lost interest of things that i used to enjoy my life doesnt have purpose anymore im tired of this and i might do it eventually i like feeling physical pain if the psycological goes away for some time imagine ending it all all goes away getting comfortable with the prospect of death by suicide a few days ago when i posted here i was on edge and crying about how im going to die early and miss out on things now i feel like im starting to accept that people which will include myself die  like i feel so numb and not afraid of death and hopefully it will stay the way till the end of may any time i dont attemptcommit i end up regretting it october of 2019 i attempted suicide it was my third attempt the first two failed this third one i was caught i spent some time in the hospital and have been in treatment since then it hasnt helped since i left the hospital ive lost my job my car my home and all my friends ive moved back west to live with family who abused me as a child i dont know what to do i think about killing myself every single day its the only thing that i can think of to make the pain stop i cant even tell my therapist because hell just put me back in the hospital and i can not go back to that nightmare i attempted suicide for the 6th time about a month ago and i legitimately cannot remember anything from the past month i\\x92ve been dissociating a lot i can\\x92t even pretend to be okay anymore i can\\x92t stop thinking about suicide i wish it would have worked so bad i feel like i wasn\\x92t meant to be alive after that i feel like i was so set on thinking that i would not be alive right now that nothing feels real anymore i did everything fucking right i did everything fucking right and i tried so hard and i still suffer i\\x92m sick of trying so fucking hard and getting nowhere and no one ever noticing how hard it is i literally physically cannot do this anymore i\\x92m maxed out on zoloft i started wellbutrin they recommended antipsychotics i don\\x92t want to do it anymore what did i do to deserve to suffer like this everyone says it gets better it fucking doesn\\x92t i want to kill myself i encouraged an aquatience to drive drunk because i was desperately hoping i would die in an accident im still alive and still nobody know about my suicidal ideation it\\x92s to the point where the only thing keeping me here is not to put my family through that but as the days progress even that hasn\\x92t become too much of a worry i\\x92ll be dead i won\\x92t deal with it i can only hope they understand why i made this decision ive had three suicide attempts in five years abd i finally figured out what i did wrong ive given life every chance to get better but the truth is sometimes it doesnt ive worked at it until there is nothing left of me money would help but the amount i need now is unattainable i learned from my mistakes i made a real plan and ive followed it for over a year the end is here i with i felt relieved but i really dont feel anything at all i\\x92m scared of myself i\\x92m scared that sometimes i will act on my thoughts even when i don\\x92t want to im too much of a pussy im too afraid of what comes after death to even attempt suicide but i really just want to die why isnt it socially acceptable anyway its my own life and i never wanted to start living so i should be allowed to end it anytime i want fuck this i cant talk anymore i just want to die i don\\x92t want anything in life i have literally no goals or ambitions i don\\x92t care about anything if money was no object i would just stay in bed i don\\x92t know what to do anymore i just want to skip to the part where i don\\x92t exist i want to kill myself again my dad wouldnt give a fuck if i killed myself anyway i want to die i want to die no matter what i just want to die failing suicide lucky or unlucky im a very unlucky person and my biggest fear is to be unlucky and fail suicide i want to die i get tricked into things and then i just cant escape and i end ruining peoples life instead of helping because im a spineless coward i think i\\x92m gonna kill myself in a month just found out something about my future and the chance of me ever being happy is close to zero i\\x92m just really great full to the people who made my life amazing for 7 good months i want my life to end somehow but i dont have the courage to commit suicide im also afraid of the sadness and shame my parents and close family will have to suffer if i do it things happened in my life 3 years ago and they practically killed my soul now im just a body that simply exists im jobless and unmarried i pretty much stay inside home almost every day i dont find any meaning to my life anymore and it doesnt make any sense to me at all when people say that you are letting others win if you commit a suicide i dont want to achieve anything anymore and i dont have anymore wishes other than to leave this world asap any words of inspiration from anyone do not practically help me at all each and every day i wish i had a cruel enemy who wanted to kill me so badly so that i dont have to commit suicide i know that in order to have a better life i have to leave my family but i\\x92m not ready to say goodbye to them i feel like leaving will create bad blood between us and make things even worse that\\x92s why i want to just die i feel so empty and alone im just struggling to stay happy at all ive felt so empty and alone my whole life and its killing me theres so major reasons rn read my last post on my account if you care anymore i feel like i need someone but ion want them to tell me what to do\\n\\n i\\x91m waiting for my loved ones to die as horrible as this sounds sometimes i\\x91m waiting for my loved ones to die normally i get rlly depressed when i see realize my parents are getting older bc that reminds me that one day they won\\x91t be around anymore but sometimes i\\x91m waiting for them to die so there is nobody left that would be hurt when i kill myself i\\x91m waiting to be the last one alive so i\\x91ll have no feelings of guilt when i can finally do it i should have pulled the trigger i really should have i want to die how i\\x92m physically exhausted all the time i\\x92m mentally tired and i can\\x92t take it anymore i feel like my relationship is going to shit i want to constantly kill myself but i\\x92m too much of a fucking pussy to do anything i can\\x92t talk to anyone about the way i feel because they either ignore me or get upset i can\\x92t fucking do anything right anymore i feel like a fucking failure im going to kill myself soon if my family sees this message know that i love you and im sorry for all my mistakes i made im going for it soon and i made up my mind sincerely damian im 20 ive been having mental health issues way before the pandemic started i truly have no motivation to keep on living other than i dont want my family to be sad ill do it when im fed up of this dont worry im good rn just needed to get it off my chest i tried to hang myself yesterday tied a scarf to the top part of my door hinge that sticks out climbed on a chair tied the scarf round my neck and stepped off all i remember is about two seconds of wow this hurts then i blacked out next thing i remember was a bunch of voices talking and chattering and suddenly i was awake in a lot of pain in the exact same position i started crying instantly from shock and managed to climb onto the chair  i still wanted to die but i couldn\\x92t bare the pain at first i thought this all happened in a few seconds but when i checked my clock i found out it was actually at least five  seven minutes which shocked me i still have a massive mark on my neck from the scarf and i\\x92m convinced that i would\\x92ve died if the knot had been a bit tighter thinking about suicide makes me feel calmrelaxed everytime when im at workhome i think about ending it and it makes me calm that i dont have to worry about my future etc in my free time i just lay in my bed making all these weird plans on how to end it looking up good places where to do it etc i work 60 hours or more a week i earn good own a house car etc but everyone left me no friends no family i am just here to work and die who would miss me when im gone i probally be replaced with another slave bye im deleting all my social media so i can focus on killing myself im just tired of living for other people thats all ive been doing surviving for other people and im tired im making this post as my last resort so i can be stopped  wrote my suicide letter have a rope around my neck i am not sad i didnt cry there are no tears on the thin paper just the small writing everywhere and a dandelion i drew in one corner there is no future for me being trans is so hard and i dont know who i am anymore its to hard to find out and being dead seems to be so peaceful i did some shit in the past and said some wrong

purpose i keep picturing myself slitting my wrists or jumping off of a bridge i dont need help i\\xa0needed\\xa0help i started becoming the person i am in middle school over a decade ago how do you make up for never learning social skills how do you make up for not knowing how to have a basic fucking conversation how do you make up for never learning how to form a meaningful connection with another human being theyre called your formative years for a reason these are all things everyone else knows how to do without even thinking about them its too late i am beyond help my entire existence has devolved into just waiting to die i\\x92m in middle school my mom hates me and always neglects me my dad left me at a young age my mom always overworks me i got aped when i was only 8 and i got abed  i also saw my mom getting abud by a very \\x93bad man\\x94 multiple times there isn\\x92t a point for me to live i should just end it all logically i should kill myself from a pure non emotional perspective i have very little chance of happiness in my future any happiness i could possibly have would only be found in the use of things like alcohol and cannabis those are not good enough reasons to stay alive i have no plans or things to look forward to theres nothing that does now or ever will make me feel fulfilled in life i honestly believe id be better off dead at this point and the only keeping my alive is my own cowardice i shall simply have to work my way up to it i dont want to commit suicide but i really really want someone to randomly walk up behind me and shoot me in the back of the head i really dont want to die but im about to kill myself i just need a sign or someone to talk to keep going please help i wanna die rn because of me being fat so i am like fat so a lot of people comment on it and today i listened to my skinny friends talk about how bad food is and stuff while im eating lots and i really just felt bad and then when i got home my mom had to mention that i look pregnant in her dress and i was like oh haha wich reminded me of how much comments i got from my grandma when i was small like she called me fat regualrly because i didnt fit in and id cry while trying on clothes and my mom has started w comments to now saying yk us woman we fat woman and yeah i just wanna starve myself to death cause i am poor and have to use my own money if i wanna go healthy and i get so tired and gove up by exxcirsising os nothing helps  sorry if bad english i rushed it now goodbye im so insecure and i want to die my insecurities kill me my exam results will kill me so ill kill myself on the day of my results to confirm my worst fears itll be better for everyone i wont bother anyone ill be fine because ill be dead hmmm i feel like cutting my own neck with a pair of scissors i just wanna bleed to death cus my parents are always arguing with me and saying all those harsh words to me im seeking help from therapy but its not helping much and i cant move out due to lack of money its better if i just end everything now i feel so hated to clarify i am trans which means that many people outright hate me and i read news articles and stuff like that about how people think i am a monster or how entire countries or religions want me dead it just makes me lose everything my faith in humanity my motivation my will to live i mean what\\x92s the point of living on this vile earth if millions already want me dead i want to leave this earth everyday i wish i didnt wake up everyone is a fucking idiot who pretends to care at the end of the day theyre all snakes my life is cursed and my ending will be by my hands ive been looking to motivate at some point everyone would just tell you that you have many things to live for the most important thing you ever have is your own are all the time ive been alive is just pain no matter where how since i have memory i have always felt like shit i dont have friends my family dont care about me my grandma passed away recently she has always made me feel better she was the reason why im still here theres aint no reason to live anymore i couldnt be more isolated from others im just feeling how time just hurts i live in latin america and all live live here is deplorable i think im just making me a favor i dont have any money to get some pills and alcohol or even a car to crash my self dont even have where to lay once im gone\\n\\n i fucking hate myself  i always feel so useless to everyone and i want to kill myself but im too scared to do it everytime i always talk to someone i feel like im wasting their time ive done a lot of things to cope with my depression talking with friends or family but im too awkward to make a normal conversation getting high andor drunk even though im not at a legal age to do these yet relaxing playing video games or listening to music i can barely enjoy doing these im worthless lazy ugly stupid and with no real friends to talk to i want it all to end but im either to exhausted to better myself or too scared to kill myself i feel constant hatred towards myself every second that im conscious someday that hatred might take over my timid nature so i can kill myself i just want to be heard without my social anxiety take over i like the feeling of being anonymous so i can vent without people knowing its me idk what to feel i feel pathetic cause every second of my life i wanna die but when pain behind my eyes and the headaches started i couldn\\x92t i started panicking like a fucking idiot the beginning felt good i wanted to keep doing it and i felt like i\\x92m finally gets g to go but then i lost oxygen and i fucking started panicking i just wish someone would just kill me for me i dont know if i can hang on my suicide is a couple months away yet im waiting for inheritance to come through so i can finalise my affairs and leave no financial burden on family it will also allow me to donate a large amount to charity i was supposed to use this for top surgery im trans ftm but its wasted as life just isnt for me problem is im struggling to hang on this long i have everything i need to to die and ive become more reckless with self harm etc by the day i have an addiction to codeine and i have been taking up to 40 tablets a day codeine and acetaminophen and i guess im hoping this will naturally kill me anyway how can i hang on to do this the right way so at least my death will ease the burden rather than add more i\\x92ve tried my hardest but i lose in everything i try i have a 39 gpa i\\x92m in shape but still my career doesn\\x92t want to hire me and women of my own ethnicity hate me will probably commit suicide by 30 if i\\x92m not a millionaire by then over the last month or so it feels like everyone has forgotten i exist my friends don\\x92t call anymore an abrupt end to a relationship my family doesn\\x92t even wanna talk to me anymore i feel isolated and forgotten by the world i\\x92ve been clean for a few weeks now but that will change tonight i want to cut my face and neck so no one will ever want to talk to me again so that this nightmare will be over maybe someone will care when i\\x92m gone i\\x92m scared if i start trying again and fail i will have the final push to go through with it they say if you believe you will be a failure you probably will i have had this mindset for so long and don\\x92t believe i can change it and i do i\\x92m afraid i will have the strength also to end it either way it\\x92s a dead end try and die or die and die i can\\x92t do this anymore ive been suffering for way too long i tried to get help but everywhere i call it\\x92s either too booked or my insurance does not accept it killing my self is the only way i could end all of my suffering im tired of always feeling like im the absolute worse of feeling like its going well until it doesnt go well this world is broken and so am i and theres nothing i can do about it i just wish i didnt look at figures of innocence with envy because i hate looking at children and seeing the spark in their eyes that is now long gone from mine im still not gonna kill myself this isnt hope its fear i dont wanna do this to the people that i know love me but part of me hopes one day ill go batshit crazy and slit the fuck out of my wrists or take a shit ton of medication and die my impending divorce and subsequent bankruptcy has me wanting to kill myself i might kill myself my mom caught me doing something worse than you could possibly imagine x 10 i was so close with her now i can\\x92t handle being alive with her thinking of me like that i think i\\x92m gonna kill myself i want to disappear hi lately i\\x92ve been really dealing with self harm and suicidal thoughts i feel like everyone i tell is annoyed by me by now and if i tell my therapist i might get sent somewhere i just hate myself and my situations my life my past will i have a future i\\x92m honestly so close to just saying goodbye i really fucking hate everyone i hate me the most and i wish i could just fucking end i don\\x92t want to exist i don\\x92t want to be in this body anymore i don\\x92t want to be gay i don\\x92t want to be a burden in everybody\\x92s life anymore i\\x92m done with all of it everybody says that i\\x92m great looking and that i\\x92m just this great person but i know none of it is fucking true they just say it to make me feel good about myself i\\x92m not desirable in anyway shape or form and i\\x92m just gonna end up dying alone as i should maybe i should just fuck my whole life up with drugs or just killing myself i don\\x92t care at this point the world would be such a better life without me i\\x92m tired of being fine for one moment then wanting to die the next i know if i tried to do anything it would hurt my family i feel like such a fucking burden disappointment and useless i may not be able to be saved but you guys can be i\\x92m sorry for being alive i\\x92m too much of a coward to try to kill myself again i\\x92m an awful person i wish i could just sleep forever should i just killllll myself now or just endure the slow painful humiliating process by continuing to sleep outside until they find my lifeless body behind this michaels arts n crafts building i wanna die i dont fit in life maybe ill kill myself soon im guessing suicidality always makes you feel like your situation is unique and hopeless even if it isnt so many people benefit from reaching out to others getting professional help medication coping skills habits changing lifestyle etc i need someone to talk to i started drinking again too and now i feel really weak maybe ill stop breathing in my sleep honestly i hope i do i dont care to live a meaningless existence anymore gonna go crash my car into a tree as fast as i can i fucking hate everyone i cant take it anymore i cant wait to finally fucking die everyday my brain tells me i should overdose the one person i love isn\\x92t mine anymore and i vent to them too much to tell them how horribly i feel right now i really want to kill myself tonight my life feels like it\\x92s falling apart i want help but i am too depressedscared to ask i\\x92m so exhausted from suffering alone i feel like ive been on the border as far as wanting to kill myself goes every day is the same in terms of not wanting to exist not enjoying things much more than 5 minutes at a time having stress about usual things that most dont and constantly thinking about waiting another month for my psychiatrist appointment improvement isnt guaranteed but improvement is guaranteed to be slow will the pain my parents suffer be worth ditching my future suffering for haha help  way of committing fake suicide i don\\x92t completely want to die but i want to end it all i have no hopes and live everyday full of shame guilt and regrets i never really prepared my future and i\\x92m at a point where i might have completely ruined my life and can\\x92t even hide it i want to give myself half of a chance i would genuinely appreciate it if you guys could share soft ways to end it all that if anyone finds me then i\\x92ll get help but if no one does then i\\x92ll still end up winning please i\\x92m quite literally tired of the struggle in life it\\x92s never going to end for me i\\x92m always crying have no hope at all any hope i do have is false have no one to talk to and the ones i do talk to have no understanding of my situation i wish every night that i don\\x92t wake up only to be mad i\\x92m alive in the morningjust useless

their success good social life career growth and relationship and im not grateful because i always experience struggles as i grow older i always telling myself if i am still worthy because i dont have anything to prove myself to people i feel weird because most of the people who i interacted didnt like me i dont have much stories to tell i dont have such experience in life i love being an introvert but i like to interact with people i just dont know how to handle it i dont want to live anymore im worthless i have severe depression and i have been doing pretty well for the last few months but since yesterday i have had just nonstop suicidal planning like as of i were planning a vacation no real emotion tied to it this has happened before but when i have been im a slump this just seemed to come out of nowhere has anyone else experienced suicidal thoughts during otherwise fine periods im thinking about setting myself on fire in the middle of the town im not actually planning to do it but imagine everyone fucking laughing at me that i m wen not knowing it gasoline and then boom i burn start burning everyone is yelling and start recording me aftter im dead some tik tokers come to my body and start lip sinking burn baby burn while my worthlees lifeless body fucking rots after a week no one cares or they make a tourist attraction out of it best place to livestream my suicide if i wanted to killmyself on live camera what would be the best platform to stream to i am having strong suicidal thoughts im 16 and i dont know what to do i have done no selfharm or anything but i feel like im losing grip to life ive been feeling worthless for months and am starting to contemplate strongly to end it all i am scared of doing it not really about the act but i am a little bit fearful about putting my family in a bad position or ruining their life but i seriously feel so lonely im tired of taking my meds and going to therapy and applying for jobs and trying to keep up with friends and trying to eat well and exercise and trying to better my life and i just want to put a fucking gun in my mouth and pull the trigger you can look at my other posts to see what ive gone through in the last year if you care to have the context the tldr is that im starting over my entire life and moving to a new city with no connections and no job prospects i changed my name and got a new phone number but i dont want to do any of it i wish i had about a hundred xanax i could down and just end it all ive overdosed three times before and survived each time god is telling me i should stay alive i need to hold on and keep going im taking steps to try and improve my life i just hate myself so fucking much i dont want to do any of it i want it all to end im tired of thinking im tired of feeling im heart broken i hate my body i hate my face i hate my voice i hate my personality i hate my trauma i hate my autism i hate my mental illness i have no joy in my life the only temporary relief i have is when im binge eating or doing drugs and then afterwards i feel like shit i want to die i cant keep holding on none of this feels real none of it fucking matters everything is a fucking nightmare im sick of it theres no hope for me im at the lowest point in my life and i choose to do nothing about it i have no strive to do anything i have nothing i am nothing i lost everything including my wife  almost killed myself today just here to say all y\\x92all people who say \\x93why do you feel this way\\x94 and \\x93why do you want to die\\x94 make me want to kill myself what are you a psychiatrist more like a psychopathanyway i\\x92ll probably do it in 1020 years when i\\x92ve paid a modicum of debt back to society better than getting old and more grumpy and ugly than i am now which is very grumpy and ugly and i\\x92m only 21 i have a feeling its going to happen very soo  i cant stop myself this time trapped in a job i hate and all i can think about is ending it im broke desperate stuck in a city i hate and all i can think of is how worthless i am and how i have nothing to look forward to my life is a dead end im so fucking worthless taking my own life seems like only one choice summer holidays just started today and everybody is so happy i don\\x92t think i can handle it i barely can handle a weekend being alone makes me think of horrible stuff everyday when my classes end i don\\x92t want to go anywhere no longer see the point help me please was almost literally on the ledge like 10 minutes ago and im still in denial that im even suicidal i feel like a terrible person because i just got into an argument with my friend and i cant tell them because then id be guilt tripping when i thought of killing myself i was overcome with anxiety im laying in bed with a strong urge to end my life and suddenly a wave of anxiety comes over me almost as if my body is responding to the thought of me ending my life here and now it felt scary and now im trying to shake the urge completely but it keeps coming back i wanna kill myself but people wont fuck off ive been thinking of killing myself these past few weeks but it seems im too fucking busy and needed to even do that  im a little bit scared ive overdosed on just lexapro before and experienced serotonin syndrome but never took so many different others together before i think it was effexor wellbutrin abilify and two others plus a few pills of adderall i took a lot does anyone know what mixing these pills will do i am sick and tired of failing constantly i cant keep going i have been a failure my whole life in every aspect i dont know what to do you ever just want to kill yourself for no particular reason like lifes not great right now but at this very moment its not terrible either yet ive been fantasizing about overdosing for the last few days it just seems so easy i catch myself daydreaming about my own suicide all the time which sounds really bad i wont do anything of course but its always in the back of my mind almost like a craving i constantly have thoughts of suicide and its scary to say but theyve gone from distressing to peaceful im not even kidding when i say i think about my death and the aftermath while im falling asleep my mental health has been deteriorating and sometimes it feels like suicide is a great option even when life isnt fucking me over is it wrong that i fantasize killing myself im between driving as fast as i can into a pole or tree or shotgun to the roof of my mouth something i can\\x92t fuck up whenever im depressed or dealing with anxiety thinking about suicide is the only thing that calms me the only reason i haven\\x92t done it yet is because i always try to find the light at the end of the tunnel lately there has been no light anytime i think i made a friend or gotten close to someone i\\x92ve been stabbed in the back im 20 and still living with my parents my parents were emotionally abusive when i was a child and are more like roommates now more than anything else i have no friends im completely alone if i get kicked out and become homeless it would be the final straw i don\\x92t have the energy to deal with this ill take the easy way out idk i\\x91ve been suicidal since i was like 10 idk why it is like that for the fact that my family is onoff a good family or nah but on and off i\\x91m having dreams of killing people in my family stabbing them to death drowning them or hitting them almost killing them or killing myself jumping into the river in midnight and shit you prolly know do yall have these too and how do you feel after you wake up im feeling guilt and regret i dont want to hurt anyone and id be ashamed to death if i hurt anyone often i wanna kill myself but i cant quite grasp the fact how my family would be ruined as in them feeling to sense to live pretty much im the only reason they\\x91re alive and here im going to make my first attempt soon im going to purchase cyanide from the dark web not the way i want to go out but it seems the easiest and most reliable way to me im not sure if i want to leave a note or video or something for after im gone or not i feel like even if i did my family still wouldnt really understand why im gone anyway so im thinking of just being gone one day life is so shitty that in order to die i will cause my family suffering fuck you life i am not but my friend is suicidal and recently attempted to overdose on pills how do i convince her not to kill herself my mental health is holding on by a thread i tore apart a razor blade and cut myself with the tiny blades today it is not deep but it is bleeding like crazy im in university and i have depression anxiety adhd and really unhealthy sleeping habits uni is so hard online and assignment deadlines are pressing things have become so much worse since things got online ive never even been to my campus for a lecture its a shit show i guess what im asking ishow should i cope without slowly going insane how do i keep up with deadlines and mental health in this ridiculous situation today i attempted to hang myself and i dont want anyone to find out i did it again does anyone know what i could do i still wonder if anyone would give a fuck at all if i just killed myself my dad wouldnt my dads girlfriend wouldnt in fact she would even be happy if i killed myself i came to the point i know i will end my life sooner or later i just let the time pass by maybe cause i subconsciously hope things are going to get better but deep down i know they won\\x92t a traumatic brain injury i had led to a mental disorder and my life won\\x92t get better matter fact it will get worse i hate when people tell me that everything is gonna be alright like how the hell do you know i\\x92m not being negative just realistic hate how society views suicide as egoistic act or coward when the only egoistic people are those who tell you to not kill yourself just for the sake of your loving ones like i should keep suffering forever just to not make you suffer right i don\\x92t want to kill myself now but i already told my family i eventually will even if they don\\x92t take it very serious i wish suicide were something quick and easy but without a gun it isn\\x92t and i don\\x92t really wanna hang i guess this would be the ultimate solution i read a lot of threads in this sub and most of y\\x92all shouldn\\x92t commit suicide life is really great when you have all your mental faculties everything is possible don\\x92t give up friends im happy but still want to die i feel kind of alone because ive never heard of anyone feeling this way on some days i can go from feeling extremely depressed to really happy all in just a couple of hours im feeling pretty happy right now but im still having thoughts of suicide has anyone else felt like this i postponed my suicide to tomorrow i guess i will be prepared better im proud for not killing myself today i coudnt do no other thingi stayed at home watching the office all day i didnt have the motivation to work or study but at least im still alive graduating college next week i think i might kill myself after that i want to die i got really fucking drunk last night and now i can\\x92t stop thinking of going and jumping off some bridge or building after a few minutes of drinking i couldn\\x92t stop crying last night and i got even more sad than i was before i feel really depressed and i hate myself for going around my online friends while i drank i suck so much as a person i deserve to die i know i do i wish i could die so much i plan on distancing myself from ppl and just die suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem yeah thats the point i will never have to deal with this shit ever again i\\x92m starting to feel like i\\x92m meant to commit suicide the same way as someone else is meant to become a doctor or to get married it\\x92s just the path i was meant to take if you say youre so depressed you cant function its aw itll get better and they forget about you then when you kill yourself everyones like oh i never wouldve thought i wish he wouldve given some sort of sign i said how many times i want to kill myself and i think i might do it but i know if i do people will act like its a huge surprise ive been serious all along i have a rope tied into a noose in a box in my room so that its always ready im not joking or just looking for attention when i tell people i need some kind of help everybody only pretends to care and then when youre dead tries to say they cared all along i attempted suicide almost died and did not regret it am i truly doomed i wanted to jump off a bridge but i got a burrito instead i bought a second one and gave it to a homeless guy hanging outside the restaurant it made me feel a bit better for the rest of the night no one cares about your life until you say you want to end it tried to shoot myself last night the bullet got stuck now i have to stay alive and do 16 assignments in 20 hours but seriously wtf what are the odds idk if its good luck or bad luck if its a sign or whatever the thing is i dont want to be alive anymore aaaaaa ima cut rn im a pedophile and i think im ready to kill myself i tried to hang myself today i need a reason to not try again tomorrow i tried to kill myself friday i took as many pills as i could and washed them down with whiskey then i took a razor blade to my arm and cut it up until my arm and my basement was covered in blood my parents found me and now i am at their house while they try to get me help i survived and now i\\x92m looking ahead to the future i must\\x92ve survived for a reason it\\x92s going to be hard but i need to at least give this a chance i hope all of you do as well take care my depression is killing my brain cells i swear im actually retarded that i even take extremely obvious sarcasm baits ironic humor seriously jesus im soo fucking dumb i dont have any critical thinking i can barely think at all i have zero comprehension as in not understanding a single word i read i cant form opinions i dont have any views and i have severe difficulty explaining my views im inarticulate another symptom of ny brain fog like i cant even talk and have constant stutter i cant think cant learn and can hardly function ive suffered for 6 years non stop tonights proved that if i hung myself tonight no one would give a shit even when i go out drinking with my friends they end up having a convo with themselves and leave me out of it even when i try to tell them my troubles they say its going to be fine and i shouldnt worry and even when i walk back home i realize that strangers and betteroff people are laughing at me behind my back im so hideous and ugly and useless to everyone i cant even tie a good enough noose to hang myself ill show them ill jump off the highest bridge iknow and be rid of all of these wicked people and the best part is no one will even care been called ugly  retarded my whole life for no reason see no point in living if all i do is get bullied the first time i wanted to kill myself i was 8 its the same old story lonely kid who didnt fit in and who didnt get the support she wanted or needed at home i felt invisible and yearned for affection i wanted to be famous simply for the adoration twelve years later and i still think about suicide every day i am just sad i have this darkness that have imprinted upon me and i cant seem to shake it a sad soul with a melancholy so profound itll haunt me even after death if theres an afterlife i never cry despite the gnawing ache in my chest begging me to kill myself just to escape it no matter the meds therapy or any of my vices the sadness stays i am killing myself tomorrow i\\x92ve looked up the metro rail schedule for tomorrow and i am planning to jump in front of the train the rail is right behind my house i\\x92m going to leave sometime when i wake up that\\x92s around 6 am and the earliest schedule is around 7 amish i was supposed to end my life today but i can\\x92t due to bad weather my parents won\\x92t let me outside  im committing suicide at 12am today recently after years upon years of deciding i realized life isnt worth it you live your life to eat sleepsimprepeat so you can prolong life some people have found their purpose and i personally find that silly your lifes sole purpose is to find happiness and thats just temporary for me atleast we are all going to die anyways ive seen thousands upon thousands of videos and articles of people who have been clinically dead feel peacefulness that theyve never experienced in their non benevolent lives and just the thought of it calms me in a way ive never felt before did i ever mean anything to anyone when im so constantly fucking replaced and ignored and spoken over and disliked always on my own maybe i will die alone too i wont kill myself right now but i really want to die i was doing so well with my intrusive thoughts and handling my ocd but its come back almost full force it has me feeling so hopeless i dont want to live like this anymore i\\x92m going to kill myself tonight hi everyone well tonight is my last night here unfortunately no one cares about me all i do is cause problems i tired reaching out just now but with no sim card i can\\x92t text or call any crisis lines and everyone around me right now laughed when i said i need to go the hospital so this is it goodbye everyone you know what\\x92s the worst part about this i don\\x92t even want to die but i feel like it\\x92s the only thing to do thanks for listening for anyone out there check up on your people thinking about jumping off a bridge or throwing myself into traffic makes me feel so calm ive been suicidal so long i dont know how to be anything else the smallest stupidest things make me want to die i want to die because i dont want to go to the grocery store because i cant find my keys because ive been avoiding talking to my family and now its awkward because im not at all the person that i want to be because i feel like im not much of a person at all its less a result of something and more of a reflex because thats the only way i know how to cope at least if it gets too much i can die i wish i was dead no one messages or cares about me im bad at everything i do i get nervous every time i go out in public i cant socialize i feel like such a failure life is grey and feels meaningless at this point and theres nothing i can do about it planning a painless suicide because of total irreversible anhedonia if this goes on for anh longer i wilk kill myself and absolutely nothing will fucking stop me id rather cut my arm off then do this anymore no amount of physical pain can match what this is nothing csn ever fucking get worse it is unbearable and i cant even cry about it i am going to kill myself but i don\\x92t want to ruin my mums life i am about to turn 18 and i have hated myself since i was 8 i\\x92ve struggled through 10 years of suffocating depression and i am so tired i am ready to die i am not strong enough to come to terms with the sexual assault that happened to me and i hate myself and my body so much that sometimes i think that i should be lucky that it happened to me at all i am beginning to think that my friends hate me even though they all tell me how much they love me the only reason i haven\\x92t ended my life is because i know it will ruin my mum and i don\\x92t want to do that to her there is nothing keeping my here and if nothing has changed by my birthday in june i am going to die i feel peaceful about this decision the thought of living one more year feeling this way is unimaginable its really weird when they talk about my future job or career or something and i just sit there squirming and feeling awkward af because i just want to die really badly and dont want a future for myself my only goal is to die or get murdered in the next 2 years and my parents think its to become a police officer i dont want to achieve anything i dont want a job or go to college i just want to end all i do is make everyone else uncomfortable because im sad all the time people just pretend to care because they dont want to feel guilty or like a bad person if i actually kill myself but its all just for show once im dead everyone will be glad that theyre finally rid of me no amount of therapy or medication will ever fix me theres no point im not living for anyone or anything whats the fucking point i wish people could see the pain i\\x92m carrying pain just pain but i can never speak of it and what i plan i really want to die i am tired of everything suicide seems like blessing right now cause death will end all my sufferings and then i can rest i thought of ending it i don\\x92t think i ever will not as long as my mom is alive it hurts so much just because i decide not to doesn\\x92t mean i don\\x92t want the pain to go away i can barely stand it anymore this morning i fantasized about a belt around my neck but of course i don\\x92t want to inconvenience others my back hurts my ass hurts my brain is tired my heart hurts my neck hurts i am always confused work and school and so tough i just want to die i won\\x92t sorry if this is the wrong thread i just really want to get away from all these obligations dying would be stupid i am 18 and i have tried to kill myself multiple times and i just want someone to talk to and maybe make some friends who went through the things i went through i wanna kill myself yeah thats the whole post my husband doesnt care that i want to die thats it i guess i got suicidal thoughts for a long time now and i think im going to finally do it it should take me 34 days before i die of a liver failure i am a young guy and i have chronic nerve pain for over a year this affects my life severely i have already received several medical treatments but with no results now i take opiates and valium to suppress the pain but still have pain i think about suicide every day i am convinced that this is the only solution to be pain free i have no hope for my future im ready to end my life maybe i deserve to die i\\x92ve had a horrible childhood and and it made me become a horrible person i was sexually abused as a child and it made me abuse people without knowing it was a bad thing until i was older when i learned what sex was it haunts me everyday and i wish i could end my life and rid myself of this constant struggle in my consciousness my day is run by intrusive and anxious thoughts and traumatic sexualization has left me with intrusiveness thoughts i\\x92d never want anyone to have and it makes me feel disgusted every time it crosses my mind but when i think of how gross it is it\\x92s like my brain forces me to see it and think about it i feel like i have no connection with my friends or anyone around me i always feel hated and like nobody truly loves me even the things i used to enjoy just bring me pain and mental suffering due to my hppd from years of drug abuse since i was 15 i\\x92m about to be 20 and i feel slower and more useless than i\\x92ve ever felt i never feel whole i\\x92m always suffering if i\\x92m not mentally absent by drug usage or just disconnected from reality i think i\\x92m gonna end it soon maybe i was meant to just die so others can live a happy life i think of killing myself soon and the thought of it is the only thing that makes me be at peace for a while parents didnt raise me right no social skills grew up with selfdoubt anxiety and fear was in love with a girl for 4 years and i ruined it she left me like it was nothing dropped out from university while my friends were graduating i was forced to do a course i didnt like by my parents and lost 4 years there doing nothing tried to do something i liked and did good in life for the first time but all i think of is how my life has been nothing but a big failure no friends im hopeless and i know future is more painful than i thought it to be i just want to end it here ive done a lot of mistakes now i just dont have the fight in me to go on with life i need peace death is the only thing that can grant me that encouraging words would only make one feel good for a day but i know theres nothing but death that can bring me to rest after all this the other night i was going to kill myself didnt and now im like hmm well i have to so and idk im just tired of living like this my thoughts are on loop and im tired of the whole cycle ive just gotta end it now i feel like im reaching a crisis point i have been diagnosed with depression and suicidal thoughts have been coming to me more and more i have multiple ways in which i think i would do it but theres just something each time that stops me i had a massive breakdown yesterday and i was stood at the top of a fire escape wanting to jump but my friend literally phoned me while i was up there so i came down and then later in the day i was going to cut my wrists but i just couldnt do it and i phoned my mum crying to her for like an hour even when i feel okay or relatively good i still think about killing myself and im scared that all it will take will be one mistake and ill be dead ew im gonna die fat thats embarrassing i cant deal with this life anymore okay its been so many years ive been saying this tho ig im telling lies and i cant even starve properly anymore ew my corpse will be ugly cant wait to be a skeleton painless suicide whats the most painless method i want to die because life seems way to exhausting i hate my shitty toxicabusive family they are so shitty i used my aunts coffee mug to drink tea and grandma snitched on me and told her and now aunt is all like \\x93i\\x92m not drinking out of it ever again cause she touched it\\x94 and when i used the can opener to open a can of tuna which i don\\x92t even use probably my first time using it this year they said they are hiding the can opener from me so i can\\x92t use it i fucking hate them they are so fucking petty and ridiculous yet i buy dish soap paper towels some food and they eat up and use all my shit and i hate them but i don\\x92t go saying you can\\x92t use that cause i\\x92m not that fucking selfish godamnnn like wtf like they hate me so fucking much and act like that then wonder why i don\\x92t talk and want to be around them at all i have a baby sister who i love dearly but its been getting worse and worse for me i hate it when she sees me depressed i hate when i wake her up bc i was t crying too loud i think she has some sort of undiagnosed autism she gas a speech impediment and is socially underdeveloped i need to kill myself but im her only friend how do i do it in a way that wont do any harm to her \\xa0want to kill myself im so sad and lonely i wish i had anybody to talk to really fucking wish i died that day\\x85 tried to suicide attempt but fucking flopped note to self eating 15 paracetomals wont kill you only fuck your body up and i really thought i was gonna do better but here we are i just want to be not around i think the actual act of suicide is terrifying as most people would think but i just constantly wish i didn\\x92t have to be born or continue on sure there are happy parts in life but it\\x92s really annoying how people argue \\x93that\\x92s worth living\\x94 because in all honesty it is not i remember about 4 years ago i almost did \\x91it\\x92 but didn\\x92t and i regret that after that i told myself it will get better but it doesn\\x92t and now even 4 years later i feel like i\\x92m stuck in such a bad place that\\x92s it\\x92s not even worth it to dig out of i make so many mistakes and never learn from them this shit has caught up to me and i have lost friends because of it no matter how hard i try i cannot improve myself i am not going to immediately kill myself after this post but it\\x92s definitely going to be in the back of my mind so many friends ghost me i have a clinginess issue and i sometimes say things that cause arguments somebody literally told me \\x93you\\x92re dead to me\\x94 so i might as well be legally dead right doesn\\x92t help that most guys i talk to i gain feelings towards i am bi and i make it sort of obvious and they ofc ghost me i don\\x92t even have to like the person to ghost me i have an unlikeable personality that cannot be changed after i release my upcoming ep i am going to make a decision is it scary to die i just want it all to be over but i dont know why i am so terrified lastnight i could have overdosed and died what stopped me my fcking fear did with the amount of atihistamine caffiene and tylenol pills that i have i could have very well been dead by morning but no i cant do it i seriously need to find a way to follow through with it i am in agonizing pain  i will kill myself because im ugly but dont know when i dont have body dysmorphism im not sure but i used to want to kill myself i was age 9 and had a abusive mother who got my custody i recently got therapy but it doesnt calm me or hell me vent recently when seeing the way the world is heading i not only want to kill myself but go on a mass murder spree beforehand i dont have the strength to do it just yet but i have a feeling its going to happen soon sorry i just needed to vent i think i\\x92m gonna kill myself idk i don\\x92t really feel anything i\\x92m a failure i let everyone down so i think once i get back to my dads tomorrow i\\x92ll write some suicide notes take a bunch of benadryl and some weed and slit my wrist in my bathtub sounds like a good plan i think but then again i literally don\\x92t feel anything rn i am tired of self harming the cuts look awful i just did a coin flip to kill myself it was kind of the only thing i wanted to do before i seriously give in but thoughts of my family is holding me back from killing myself atm i dont wanna die i want to live i want happiness i want this pain to leave me alone i need help but theres no one to help i tried to kill myself and i want to try it again i tried to slit my wrists but didnt even hit the vein it was pathetic i felt like everyone in the hospital was just laughing at me i told my parents if they didnt make me go to inpatient i wouldnt try it again but i want to so bad im in so much pain all the time i keep wishing my life would just end i want to get out ahead i have this feeling deep inside of me that i know its a truth that despite my general contentedness at this point in time ive peaked from here it can only get worse im not brave enough to actually actively commit suicide but i find myself wishing my heart would just stop beating in my quiet alone moments i was thinking how can i reach out for help or better yet what are some ways to curb suicidal thoughts im not so bad yet that ive attempted but i think about multiple times daily how could i reach out or stop some suicidal thoughtssadly some of this is incited by one of my cats starting roche mean to me because my cats are probably the only reason im here except for my sister please tell me a way i cant kill myself i cant cut because im a pussy ive been considering drowning and ive tried it but i dont know my life is going to be fucking hell more then now in a couple years even more then now im to mentally il to get a job and i dont have any friends really il just be sitting in my house on disability befits for 40 years its going to be so fucking miserable im a waste of resources fuck me dont fucking tell me it will get better im tiered of hearing it im done i think im going to try to drown myself tm idk hope i found a better way just please help me with this im in pain and i need to end it i\\x92ve wanted to end my life since i was maybe 1213 i\\x92m 17 now and haven\\x92t thought about suicide or depression in months i always thought things would simply just get better and eventually they kinda did after i got my girlfriend back in november everything seemed fine but now she\\x92s been kinda distancing herself from me and ignoring me and saying she\\x92s annoyed from my presence and like 23 days ago i just got so lonely that i just started thinking about life and suicide and everything bad that was happening to me before i had my girfriend i mean i\\x92m not gonna kill myself if she leaves me or anything because if i kill myself over a partner i\\x92ll seem stupid or dumb i just finally came to my realization that everything is still bad even after i got my girlfriend and i was just so focused on her that i never had my thoughts of suicide because i was happy with her now i just came back to my realization about how i was before my girlfriend and killing myself in a few years like i planned to just has came naturally these past few days and it just doesnt seem bad thing for me to do i just want to die i no longer want to be a burden in this world all i ever do is disappoint and make people mad and sad i just wanna hang myself the worst thought i have ever had and keep having is that when i kill myself ill be too heavy to to be picked up im fat i dont want to be here i\\x92m trying to keep up with the pace but i keep falling behind my mind is a hole i fall into when i wake filled with pain i try to escape i just want to give up my life i take i don\\x92t care if it gets better it will only get worse because i\\x92ll wait for the pain to come back fear that i\\x92ll fall again into that dark abyss i won\\x92t ever get out when i feel i\\x92m digging up i\\x92m really digging down into a deeper hole to hit rock bottom there\\x92s no rock bottom i think life can only be so bad but then i hit the core and now i\\x92m burning burning at every mistake word and thought then when i speak it\\x92s like my throat is ash every pronunciation of a word is another foot deeper in the hole the people look at me and i just fall deeper the people ignore me and i die almost got enough fluoxetine to finally do what ive been wanting to since i was 12 ive been pretending to take my pills for a few days i take 60 mg a day with the bottle i already have plus a refill from my pharmacist ill have 1000 mg available to me finally i just feel like no one wants me around even though ive been told this isnt the case but still i just want to kill myself i started on antidepressants two weeks ago because my doctor said theyd be useful in time to help manage feelings but so far theyve done nothing every day is a struggle to keep myself alive since im barely eating im starting to lose weight i cant focus on anything i enjoy i live in a toxic environment because my mom is a narcissist and its so draining to be around her i just want to feel better i honestly cant do it anymore home is too toxic trauma haunts me more and more i cant be supported or accepted for who i am i cant escape i cant do run away i cant i just cant idk what to do theres nothing left to help me i really just wanna die im scared please someone just help me trying to get help but i just wanna die so i\\x92m bipolar and suffer from codependency my only coping mechanism were cocaine and sex i recently started going to therapy and started taking medication but i got hurt and i instantly attempted\\x85 um i woke up in a hospital after two days and now i\\x92m getting real help but i honestly don\\x92t know what to do i\\x92m trying like i said i\\x92m in and optionally home i could leave but i won\\x92t but it\\x92s hard and i wanna leave i miss my flat i miss my drugs i miss my mate i miss my dog i just feel like life would be easier if i just turned it off and started doing drugs sorry i needed to rant and i\\x92m asking for advice i just want to die i used to think about killing myself but then be too scared to experience the pain of sitting my wrists or stabbing myself but honestly the last few months i find myself not caring if it hurts i honestly just want to fucking die i fucking hate everyone around me so i don\\x92t care how they feel when i\\x92m gone i just want to not exist anymore it\\x92s not always so much that i want to kill myself sometimes i just wish i was never born or i could get hit by a car or something god i want to kill myself so bad i guess i am having anxiety attacks my brain goes completely numb sometimes when i am asked to do a thing i cant function i have a family history of mental illnesses and i hate those people my family is so full of shit in every regard of life i dont want to be like them at all but i cant help but keep falling into the same path what should i do my life is ruined i wont be able to achieve the life i always wanted fuck my household they ruined me i was destined to be nothing fuck my life fuck destiny fuck each and every one of my family members all my friends are doing good but not me i am hitting the lowest of lows in my life killing myself is the only answer hate my life i want to get this off my chest i hate the way i look my laziness my life i dislike it i\\x92ve tried working out getting a better schedule getting hair products but i can\\x92t keep doing whatever i\\x92m doing i\\x92m just tired i don\\x92t wanna do this anymore i avoid looking in mirrors cause i genuinely hate how i look i hate school and my social anxiety makes me want to kill myself everytime i leave my house i\\x92m becoming an adult and i don\\x92t want to be an adult looking and feeling like this i\\x92ve been bullied and had no friends i thought that i had improved but i haven\\x92t i tried to cut my wrist but the blade was to blunt i can\\x92t even do that right i feel so ugly and abnormal i feel like everyone is staring at me judging me but before someone says they aren\\x92t they are i had a group of girls stare and make fun of me i\\x92m so tired i can\\x92t go anymore i really just want to escape this crap of a life i have i am dumb poor and ugly i cant do shit i just want to die and go to a different world like in animes i legit have no idea i\\x92m almost done with uni just got my first job i\\x92ve got hobbies i\\x92m passionate about i\\x92m in a healthy relationship i hate myself i haven\\x92t cut myself in weeks purely because it doesn\\x92t even give me the high i\\x92m looking for i\\x92ve just been doing everything you\\x92re supposed to do i wanna die i wanna die i\\x92m a piece of shit i thought doing everything right would make me feel good i kinda feel like killing myself would still be kinda cool i just want to be forgotten so so tired of constantly never being enough not pretty enough not smart enough not clean enough not well enough put together i didn\\x92t deserve all of the abuse and suffering i\\x92ve gone through in this pathetic life i\\x92m tired and i don\\x92t want to do this anymore i just want to give up and end it all i guess that makes a coward huh a selfish coward at that most people think the reasoning behind suicide is not feeling like anyone cares or that no one would miss you but for me that\\x92s not the case i know people love me and that\\x92s what\\x92s holding me back anytime something difficult happens i just think to myself \\x93if i kill myself i won\\x92t have to deal with this\\x94 i\\x92m a terrible person and though people would miss me i would definitely be better dead because all i do is hold people back i\\x92m completely useless i mean i can\\x92t even do my homework i\\x92m failing in just about every class and there\\x92s not enough time for me to catch up the term will end soon i\\x92m a lazy piece of shit who stays in their room and cries i complain about how much my life sucks but i never do anything to change it i always blame everyone else for how i feel i\\x92m not strong enough or motivated enough to live i just don\\x92t want to do it i\\x92m a wuss i\\x92ll admit it i just can\\x92t handle life i mean death is inevitable i may as well save the time right i want to die i want to die i want to die my own family doesn\\x92t even love me i have plans now now i think of it it might be painful but the pain in the life is everyday this will be one time and im gone forever after all why shouldnt i do it nobody would care other than the mess i will make slitting is the best i can do i cannot live like this this is painful guess this is my time i wouldnt care much about pain if it werent for the only thing i could kill myself with is a knife or pills that have an extremely low lethality and if it hurts too much id probably just puss out even if i manage to go through with it id probably wake up in a hospital and have to deal with everyone knowing about it i just wish i had a gun or rope so i could do it easily and almost certainly die i\\x92ve never been so alone in my life i keep saying that but it keeps getting worse and i don\\x92t know how much longer i can handle it i don\\x92t think any longer honestly spending the last half hour of my birthday crying and alone because i\\x92m not worth anyone\\x92s time i am an afterthought fuck this semester going badly might end my life finals coming up getting an a in one class failing the others deal isolated from friends mentally unhappy can\\x92t rally to pepper because clubs are dead at my school thinking of throwing myself on i70 used to be good at engineering now due to covid i am not i have no hands on experience because of covid no company will hire me i deserve to die i consider myself a failure my dads in the intensive care unit at the hospital and all i keep thinking about is cutting myself im going to kill myself today if my boyfriend leaves me ill most likely kill myself i know this sounds toxic as fuck i never have nor will i ever hold something like this against him but i am scared shitless that if he ever leaves me i won\\x92t have the courage to move on he\\x92s the only reason i want to do anything he\\x92s my only form of happiness i made my decision im planning on killing myself in a month or 2 i promised id end it this year its the only one i intend to keep i know how absolutely useless i am and i dont care what happens to me or my family because this isnt real i dont feel a connection to anything or anyone its all meaningless i would rather die than be conscious for longer i was going to kill myself three days ago i reached out for help i called two of the three people i feel like i\\x92m at all close to i got routed to daily inpatient psych visits and some new referrals and meds i regret all of it i wish more than anything i had just had the resolve to kill myself instead of being too afraid of the pain i wish that i had died and never asked someone for help i have been suicidal for over five years attempted suicide at least 10 times but have never actually been serious about it tomorrow i have decided i will go to a local bridge there i will finally make the decision of whether or not i should end it all if anybody cares i will update this tomorrow if i am alive if im not well its been one hell of a ride suicidal again haven\\x92t felt suicidal in about 7 years in hindsight i blamed the drugs well it\\x92s back but not the drugs the problem is now i\\x92ve got a wife and three kids what kind of a pussy leaves that behind part of me wants to head down to the hood and start throwing around the n word in hopes of getting gunned down but that ain\\x92t my luck i\\x92d just become the racist asshole trending across the globe i can\\x92t think of an \\x93accidental\\x94 method outside of a car accident and that offers no guarantee i\\x92m tired every thing is too hard for me to do at this time i have two bottles of vodka which i am thinking of chugging and just stop the pain please help mei have bought the necessary materials to a painless suicide obviously i will not list them and i am planning to take my life tonight every second i become less motivated to live and i need help asap i\\x92m terrified my life is fucked i think someone is hacking into my phone i wanna die ive got to kill myself before i get kittens my mom knows that i like cats so shes trying to get me a kitten i cant leave it alone because my family doesnt like cats so ive gotta kill myself before i get one i wanted to commit suicide today but then i got taco bell instead next time i want to commit suicide im keeping it to myself telling people aint worth it its not like they arent still going to judge you if you do kill yourself they dont understand the pain please just allow me to die it never fucking does people have even telling me that for years and it\\x92s only gotten worse i\\x92ve lost most of my friends and i\\x92m finding it so hard to make new ones nobody really fucking cares about me it\\x92s all just fake bs i\\x92m considering just ending it all life fucking sucks i just came up with 22 reasons to kill myself i can\\x92t come up with any reasons to live not one lately all i can think about is suicide i\\x92ve been suicidal for years and it keeps getting worseit\\x92s at the point where suicide is the only thing i think about i cannot get any help since i\\x92m still 17 and my parents refuse to get me help i had a psychologist for a while but it didn\\x92t help at all i\\x92m in so much pain and i can\\x92t do this anymore i just want to stop existing sure i want to be dead but am not interested in the pain thats involved i want to just not exist eternal sleep im exhausted what am i even trying for too bad i wuss out im going to kill myself nowhopefully this time ill be successful helloin the end i have to kill myself because i just cant stand myself everything i do or say makes me a piece of shit so rather then being alive and be a garbage person all the time i wanna kill myself so i wont be able to do any other shitty things i dont know why i am this way i guess that much of rotten person i dont know why im alive to begin withso hopefully this is the day ill put an end to all of this killing myself i keep trying today is the day i must get it over with i cannot live like this anymore i was a good man goodbye everyone im thinking of jumping off the bridge on the way home tomorrow idk its not like im in constant pain or anything i kinda just give up i fell behind on everything while everyone else seems to be doing just fine i cant memorize or focus on anything i just feel blank the world around me is moving too fast and im always a hundred steps behind i cant even feel motivated to try and do better because i know every possible outcome would leave me just as miserable i put it off for a while because i didnt want to cause my family such shame but im kinda over that now im too tired im intentionally destroying my lifei started smoking weed and drinking alcohol in an attempt to set my self down the path of slowly killing myself thinking of drinking myself to death soon so it can be over there is really no point and i have no motivation to live as nothing satisfies me anymore i dont know if its for real this time but i just feel like i can never fix what ive done and there is no way someone would help me i really just want to give up i really feel like suicide is the only way out of thisim still waiting for the day i break i guess i don\\x92t want a reason to live i don\\x92t want my life to be saved by anybody or anything i just wanna die i don\\x92t even wanna be happy i just wanna die i had a dream about killing myself i tried to hang myself in my backyard while my brother was watching me maybe soon this dream will come true school is making me suicidal i only started college a few weeks ago and im already feeling the stress if i fail my sem again i will be kicked out in my country ur basically useless if u dont have a college diploma i currently have no support system and my parents are super abusive i\\x92m tired of faking like i\\x92m feeling okay all day and then falling back into my depressive states and crying myself to sleep at night it\\x92s like a weird routine i\\x92ve caught on because no one around me takes it seriously they usually make me feel ashamed for being depressed i\\x92m so tired of living at this point im living life out on the sole fact that im curious about what future college ill be attending what dating feels like what job ill end up with who ill end up with and the likes if it werent for all that i might have already stopped trying by now to be honest its getting harder to look forward to these things but i keep telling myself to live it through for the hell of it i dont actually want to die i just want things to change but 6 or however many attempts later idk i lost count its clearly not changing things clearly dont get better i dont understand why i dont just kill myself right now theres something holding me back and i dont know what my boyfriend who fucking knows all i know is that right now i feel just as worthless as ever before and asking myself for the millionth time when will i get a fucking break when will i not hate every waking minute of my life lol the only good thing in my life is my boyfriend and with my track record im going to fuck that up too so  i dont want to hurt him i really dont and i know if i killed myself it would hurt him but i got a life time of trauma at 18 and it eats away at me day in and day out and nobody can make it stop im killing myself tonight im saying it here because nobody can know other than the internet dont try to talk me out of it failed a year of med school thinking about killing myself i have always been a very high achieving student but this year has been very rough for me due to struggling with depression i failed my third year of medical school and i am going to have to repeat it because of that medicine is already too long 7 years in my country and i feel like i have wasted away my life i am really considering to end it all there is no way in hell i can accept failing a year as someone who has always been one of the top students is shooting yourself in the head a painless way to die today this is one of the few thoughts i had and i really need an answer i don\\x92t know how to kill myself so that i feel no pain and this seems like an option if not what painless ways are there goodbye nobody cares so im gonna kill myself how do i kill myself i should have been dead almost a decade ago i was diagnosed with type one diabetes on my 8th birthday and should have died then no one knows or cares that i exist most ive met either have forgotten me or agree i should be dead ive tried overdosing on insulin but now i have a dexcom and its just harder to do it again im so fucking worthless not ever the dead want me so how do i kill myself if you want anymore information please just look at my past posts im to retarded to do anything and might just go with a knife if i cant do anything else i am going to give 40 some unit of insulin tonight im so tired my plan is to slowly degrade myself i have been thinking and i also saw another post that inspired me to do this i will slowly degrade myself meaning eat junk food no excercise start doing drugs and maybe alcohol death will come sooner and its the most painless way imo just takes more time recently i have begun to feel more and more suicidal after an argument and a huge sense of guilt due to this i have stopped telling people how i am feeling the only person i tell is my therapist i regularly picture my suicide different ways to do it how people will react what i would write to people i have written multiple drafts i dont know if i will do it because i am scared of what it will be like and the thought of there being nothing after this is a strange thing to comprehend but i also think that i am capable of doing it as i can be very reckless and make decisions or do things with very little thought when i think about killing myself sometimes i feel comfort sometimes i feel sad and sometimes i just dont feel anything i dont really know what im asking here but i just thought i best put it out somewhere because it is a thought that plagues my mind for a good portion of the days im just sad i just stay alive so the people i like dont have to be sad but i dont even know if they would notice i mean not a single soul would miss me i think and if i die in an accident today i would be happy because im finally dead and other people dont have to ask themselve why i killed myself but if im honest i just wanna kill myself i need info on how hospitals hold people i dont feel safe with myself and i almost hung myself but didnt and i dont know what to do i dont have money for a hospital at all so im not sure this is worth asking but its worth a shot if i decide to wake up tomorrow fuck my cutscratched my arm so fucking much i got mad and i scratched my arm with a blade from a pencil sharpener this one was very fucking sharp so now i have fucking red marks all over my arm i cant lay down because it stings and starts bleedingi think il just sleep with my hoodie can anyone help insufferable pain it feels inhumane for someone to suffer like this and continue on to do so this is so fucking painful i wont be able to take it any longer i just wanna go id give anything to have it in me to end my life i just cant fucking do it anymore i have no one im not able to get myself to shower or do dishes or look into jobstherapy or even think about going back to school nothing i want it all to be over im sick of being useless i bring suffering in my wake itd all be so much better if i were dead so fucking much better is this where i give it all up i want to end it so badly i honestly dont know whats keeping me going and id love to get help but ik my step mom would get pissed i dont know what to do anymore i came out as nonbinary and my parents go out of their way to use my dead pronouns and that hurts a lot subconsciously killing myself i used to have so many plans of ending my life different ways timings i dont have those thoughts anymorebut i feel 10x more suicidalif not more i feel like im in denial about my depressionsuicide ive never seen anyone to diagnose me therefore i feel my emotions are invalid and just attention seeking ive been pushing away my feelings of sadness for some time nowmaybe even years but its recently hitting me hard again i dnt feel like killing myself but i feel like im killing myself subconsciously im using hard drugs now drinking daily and twice as much im driving recklessly and working poor i dont feel suicidal but ive realized ive gave up is this subconscious or just a bump in the road suicidal thoughts i don\\x92t want to kill myself i just wanna go to sleep and never wake back up i\\x92m so tired of living this horrible life school just makes it worst and i\\x92m tired of it i feel like today is that day to end all my pain and worries im fucking done i just want to die i dont know how to do it i dont eant my family to have to pay for my coffin how can i do it without gettkng found i dont want therapy i just want to kill myself i cant stand it anymore i am afraid that my family and friends will miss me but the pressure is too much and i dont think i will be eable to take it longer im sorry why do people reach out to you knowing you\\x92re suicidal and then complain about you being suicidal does that make any sense it seems like nobody has a brain these days i\\x92ve been planning this attempt for a while tbh why i\\x92m going trough with it i dunno honestly i have everything a teenager could ask for it\\x92s just i\\x92m existing for the sake of existing i\\x92m tired of being a failure i know that my family doesn\\x92t care anymore and i know help will never come askingreceivinggiving and taking nothing is here to help i\\x92m just breathing wasting time someone else could have had i plan on being nice to everybody this week before it\\x92s over i hope everyone can be happy together for a while i stopped imagining heaven because i know people like me wouldn\\x92t be there on their best days i just want this to be over i have no worth i find that everyone in my life is better than me i\\x92m always interrupted my ideas are always shot down i\\x92ve been a failure all my life and no matter what i do i\\x92m too tired or too stupid to do it i\\x92m too scared to ever end my own life but i know if i did life would go on and i\\x92d be forgotten by those who loved me sometimes i wish i had the guts to do it but i don\\x92t think i ever will i really wanna die i mean i know im not special and all because everyone has their own struggles but no one ever listens to mine im always everyone elses support but whenever someone tries to reach out to me i just completely shut down my parents are both shit to me and i feel like i really wouldnt regret dying its just hard for me to suppress all of these thoughts and soon i feel like im going to do it i wish theres an easy way to kill myself id be already dead if death is guaranteed when i kill myself what if i dont die but fall into a coma or worse continue living as a suicide survivor i dont think ill ever be able to face my parentsfriends when that happen isnt it too embarrassing i am so tired of everything i dont even want to type here anything because it doesnt matter i just want to meet someone and hug them i hate myself so fucking much i wanna die right now i am a girl who has yet to finish high school and i have struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm since the 7th grade today i made the mistake of missing the bus by a minute because i forgot my keys and didnt want to be locked out because of that i had to ask my step dad for a ride he said okay while my mom proceeded to yell at me over text about how stupid i am how much of a failure i am how i made her get up early to get the kids ready for school etcshe didnt say that but it felt like that i now have to do millions of chores when i get home i now have to be at the bus stop 10 minutes earlier than my usual time and i will probably lose my phone for a week i honestly just wanna die i have been so stressed because of school and my life just keeps going to sht so i honestly just wanna die im not sure how or if i should but honestly this was my breaking point what do i do keep fighting this horrible battle or finally just tap out the pain is crushing me i cant keep pretending everything is fine im so close to the breaking point no one knows how much i want to do it and i dont know how much longer i can take it everyone thinks im so happy but the truth is im so tired of faking it i am not cut out for this world i\\x92ve really been making a genuine effort to keep trying for my family\\x92s sake but recently nothing has been working out and it feels like the world doesn\\x92t want me i can\\x92t find a job i can\\x92t find a place to live i just want to give up and be done with it after taking about 100 pills and alcohol i had seizures and then everything was a blur everything hurts i cant stop crying im on a drip and oxygen i have no motivation to live and i cant die i need help i just want to blow my fucking brains out everyday i feel less like myself no one fucking understands what goes through my head it\\x92s so unexplainable if my parents were to die i wouldn\\x92t be able to have the emotions i would usually have i would just feel no emotion i fantasize a bullet entering my skull cracking it going through my brain destroying everything i know and just ricocheting my entire fucking brain losing my thoughts and what make you you is the worst fucking hell and agony i\\x92ve felt i would rather have everyone i know die and become homeless consume every other problem then to lose my personality and i\\x92m losing it  i\\x92m really depressed and i need to talk to someone i\\x92m feeling really depressed and lonely and really could use a friend to talk to i feel like sobbing and hurting myself i\\x92m contemplating suicide and hanging myself i\\x92m thinking of trying it from a pulley system thanks goodbye if i don\\x92t get back in time school is about to end i don\\x92t know what i want to do with my life i feel like i\\x92m just wasting time and money on trying to get a well paying job to impress other people and to prove to people that i\\x92m not as stupid as they thought i amwas i honestly want to die i see no meaning in living in this rat race i wanted to kill myself last nigh i didn\\x92t have a plan just a bottle of gin and my clothes to fashion into a rope i walked over 15 miles in the middle of no where trying to find a good enough spot i just ended up sitting there crying my eyes out and it felt good i haven\\x92t cried in a long time i thought i\\x92d reach out to the out of hour\\x92s doctors they said they would call me back but my phone died obviously because they could get through to me police were called and know all of my family knows i guess i want to die i just don\\x92t want to kill myself and that\\x92s okay my whole life i struggled with my mental health keeping it a secret from my family when i was young my mom had me admitted because i would cry randomly so from there on i just tried to pretend that everything was okay im tired of feeling like my back is against a wall im tired of having financial problems im tired of being addicted to drugs im just tired of life i just want to go to sleep im tired im so fucking tired i often realize that there is nothing i can do to stop this horrible pain i feel in my head even when i should be fine its still there i should be fine im not fine everything still feels like its all falling apart its never ending it just quiets down its like a hum in my head a hum thats stuck and i cant get it out i cant help but think im hopeless and helpless i want to die i want to go see my dog again im done i wish so badly that i had access to all the tools adults have guns cars poison i mean im only 16 but i cant get any of that i dont wanna wait another couple years to get them either but i have to so idk fuck man i just want to die im thinking about committing suicide but dont want to upset family members or friends thats the only thing stopping me and i feel more and more tempted by the day im thinking about just overdosing and finally ending it i dont want to but i feel theres no other option feeling so alone i\\x92m at this point in life where i feel so empty and i don\\x92t want to keep going i don\\x92t have a boyfriend anymore and i don\\x92t have any friends i\\x92m failing several classes as well with nobody to blame but myself things at home aren\\x92t that much better either i just want some reason to keep going just something i don\\x92t have any desire to live past at least next week i just want it all to stop i wrote a suicide letter i\\x92m thinking about ending everything tonight i can\\x92t take this anymore i\\x92m alone nobody cares and i\\x92m afraid that if i tell a family about this they will have me institutionalized i don\\x92t want to live anymore this sadness has become too much to handle i just want to stop existing no one cares about me everyone hates me my mental illness is too much for them to want to deal with everyone wants to argue with me and blame me for things i just want to erase myself from the minds of everyone that ever knew me i want to disappear into a dark hole and never be heard from again i want to die but even more than that i want to never have existed at all no one cares this is just like shouting into space no one even responds on this sub i know i will die by my own hand and no one will even try to stop me because my life is meaningless it\\x92s all done my boyfriend doesn\\x92t care about me only himself we argue a lot but i\\x92ve been trying to make things better and he doesn\\x92t seem to get that the things he does makes things worse and that\\x92s why i start mentioning why i\\x92m sad i told him i was upset and he didn\\x92t care i\\x92m going to cut again today i\\x92m not clean for long but now i want it to be a habit again i\\x92m tired of being hurt all day and i need to feel something else why does he do this to me i wish i had the guts to kill myself because i\\x92d have already done it by now part of me wants him to know so he realises what he\\x92s doing is affecting me but he wouldn\\x92t care either way he\\x92d probably be happy i was gone i need help i\\x92m slowly started back cutting  i don\\x92t want to but i have an urge i\\x92m tired of living and when i want help or i want to talk to somebody no ones there for me but i\\x92m always there for them i stopped eating two weeks ago and no one noticed and i\\x92m just can\\x92t live life anymore i\\x92m tired of school i\\x92m tired of everything i just need someone to tell me to go killmyself in my face from someone personal or someone i care about or i need something bad to happen to me please god please i want to fucking die i cant stand living on this wretched earth anymore cant eat a full meal without busting into tears because i want to fucking kill myself 3 more months left until my birthday gonna end it then i want to die i\\x92m just too weak for this world i can\\x92t take it anymore i just want to give up once and for all   i\\x92m feeling really hopeless right when it starts getting better it just gets worse i can\\x92t do this

really hard time again im so alone im so alone and im gonna be alone forever i dont want to live i dont want to grow up with the pain seeing my family die before me seeing the people that left me

i wish people stayed with me i wish i wasnt so horrible and made people uncomfortable i wish i was normal i really want someone to kill me i want to die in some way i dont want to go to hell am i alone i\\x92m afraid on a daily basis that i\\x92m not good enough for the people who need me to be good enough i spend almost all of my time worried that i\\x92m dispensable forgettable and undesirable i feel alone and ashamed i hate myself more and more every day i can\\x92t feel normal just need to vent my parents emotionally traumatized me and then all of a sudden they give a fuck they go around acting like some fucking god and then treat me like shit and expect me to tell them everything like what the fuck are you drunk or someting where is your head they are insane if they think i\\x92m going to go up to the people that put me in this state and ask them for help why wouldnt i want to die when i got nobody to go to but 3 people online and i cant even get a genuine hug all the people that actually give a damn are somewhere on the other side of town i dont even have fucking hope for the future i thank you for wasting your time have a good day he left me with his pain my soulmate my bestfriend he took his life and blamed it on me he knew about all my trauma and decided to take his life when i finally did what was best for me he\\x92s gone now he\\x92s not breathing anymore and i can\\x92t live with these what if\\x92s or what i could\\x92ve done i\\x92ve never been more suicidal before this i want to be with him his family blames me i can\\x92t deal with anymore trauma years and years go by and more trauma enters my life i didn\\x92t even expect to make it this far in life i wanna go i wanna go wish i died my tire blew out on the highway because it was mounted wrong im so upset that i didnt die i wish i panicked and rolled my car i had a friend die from the same thing a few years ago why didnt i die its not fair im scared im going to impulsively kill myself i have extrem mood swings and at one point i could be looking at a future for myself and at another im close to jumoing out of my window or oding i really want to just be sent to an emergency room and receive some sort of treatment but everyones going to judge me everyone maybe its for the best if i impulsively kill myself i want to feel pain if i\\x92m gonna end it then i\\x92m going out in the most brutal ways possible rather it be setting myself on fire or mutilating myself with a fucking chainsaw i do not want it to be quick and i want to be found just completely fucked up beyond recognition maybe i\\x92ll end up in hell where i deserve to be if it even exists i will kill myself because of bullying i get bullied since i was 5 i am 16 now i never had friendsthere is no hope i hate my life my parents say i should ignore but i got bullied almost every year in my life this will be the end i\\x92m such a fucking loser please just somebody kill me let me just go to sleep and not wake up that would be an absolute godsend i\\x92m failing my classes  everything is online i can\\x92t get anything printed i work all day and still i can\\x92t get a good passing grade this shit is so fucked my mental health was terrible anyway and now everything is worse i hate being alive i literally want to kill myself i know this shit isn\\x92t even that big of a deal but i just i can\\x92t do it anymore therapy fucking sucks everyone sucks i can\\x92t do this i want to kill myself i really want to end it nothing has helped no therapy no talking to people nothing im simply too far gone i probably will end up killing myself soon i just dont know how to do it what do you do when you know you are gay but your last and only 2 gay relationships made you feel afraid and traumatised to be gay so you lie and say you are straight i don\\x92t want to be gay as it leaves me wanting to die i recently got into a break up and i just feel so lonely i literally have nobody to talk too about my breakup my family hates when i talk about him but i literally keep it all inside and i just need some guidance and motivation to help me move on\\x85 because i already feel like going back when you feel so lonely you always feel like you gotta go back to that person when you have nobody on your side  does anybody feel this way or is it just me i already have thoughts of suicide even though i have a long life ahead of me and i\\x92m still young i\\x92ve been having thoughts about it but i never really tried to hurt myself  i don\\x92t think that because he left me and what not  but i have thoughts because i have nobody and my therapist is always telling me \\x93you\\x92re never alone\\x94 but i am  and i just don\\x92t know what to do anymore\\x85 i just need guidance and motivation to help me move forward and make good choices in my life because i\\x92m already giving up at this point \\x85 so in your opinion if the voices that keep talking nonstop are getting louder and scarier and you had a choice would you check yourself in right away or make an appt with a new counselor because your new to town and have no therapist and no meds im so scared i want it all just to end so the voices will stop but i dont want my granddaughters or daughter to find me since i live with them i lost my brother to suicide in 2005 and i know what it did to all of us but i also understand feeling like its your only option please help me  the fear of depression is living with it forever hello everyone well what more is there that say i am alone in this big world i feel very alone i do want to enjoy life but i feel i have nothing to offer and time is running out i pray the good lord shows mercy i\\x92m looking to end my pain i just want my pain to end i\\x92m so tired tired of pretending i want to live tired of pretending i am ok and i am tired of living a lie to appear \\x93normal\\x94 when all i want is my old life back i want to leave this place as this is hell and i want to sleep forever as i can\\x92t take\\x85 see more its not meant for me to be anything but sad alone hurt and scared just wish it would end i just cant anymore im done i give up i tried and i cant can i just not wake up tomorrow please\\x85 i started taking an antidepressant and my suicidal thoughts and depression is gone a lot of people are against taking antidepressants but its better to take those than wanting to kill yourself all the time just suggesting it because its helped me a lot i want to die so bad right now my heart just keeps breaking and i can\\x92t seem to i stop the thoughts in my head its been a while since ive been on this page to vent about myself im sorry i try to come here to offer some words of encouragement but today im struggling i just feel horrible and would like to go to sleep permanently having social anxiety plus fear of being left out i just feel like quiting anytime soon every day i watch my debt go down because once it\\x92s gone in about 3 years i can put my end of life plans into action rather than just the self harm to numb things personally i don\\x92t want to talk to anyone about how i feel why are we continually bombarded with requests from help groups telling us to chat open up reach out etc\\ndon\\x92t these support groups get it if someone has made their mind up and is comfortable with their decision to kill themselves  why would they want to discuss their decision with a complete stranger\\nit\\x92s my decision i\\x92m happy with it i\\x92ve thought about it over a long time i feel alone and hopeless fuck my life what are we doing just another day towards sad and lonely death and if you are not dying everyone else around you is i have been doing good for a while now it is back i want to

try to teach me stuff then i\\x92ll say \\x93it doesn\\x92t matter i won\\x92t be around much longer since i\\x92m planning on suicide y\\x92know\\x94 and they don\\x92t even care they\\x92ll be all \\x93okay well if that doesn\\x92t happen how are you going to buy a house you need to build credit\\x94 i\\x92m just upset with how much they seem to not care if i actually attempted i\\x92m sure they would be shocked not like i told them i\\x92d do it right to their faces is it wrong for me to avoid building credit because i\\x92m suicidal i don\\x92t know if it actually matters that much marimba is a really weird instrument it reminds me of the jungle the rain old games with 8bit soundtracks and being in freezing cold band halls anxiously waiting to audition the only thing i don\\x92t really understand is why why do i feel like this why am i so attached to an instrument that has only ever felt weird to play the only reason i ever played marimba was to get attention from my parents because my older brother had done so well and literally got in the newspaper because of it freshman goes to state for music on the first try everyone knew my brother and sister and they would shove it in my face that\\x92s why i played marimba because it seems like everything i do no matter what that thing is i end up fifteen steps behind my older brother people tell me to stop comparing myself to others then immediately do just that i cut myself because it was a temporary release for my emotions and instead of my family offering me help they just got mad more disappointment more stress why is it that i have to cut myself for them to hear me to see me i tried killing myself about a month or two ago because i felt so bad being known as the disgrace of the family all because of my grades my father told me that he thought i was the smartest out of all of his kids but i was wasting that exponentially by not doing my work even now i\\x92m supposed to be working but no i\\x92m sitting in my bed whilst listening to tchaikovsky and chopin whom i hate right now as his piano pieces are too hard and fast or the complete opposite and slow easy which upsets me to great lengths anyways the obvious solution to this would be staying on task and finding my own thing that i like but in the process of copying my elder siblings i have essentially become a watered down version of them like a dollar tree version all the same interests none of the talents it\\x92s gotten to the point where i\\x92m so stressed out that i can\\x92t focus i always have to have something in my hands or i freak out ex i can\\x92t walk in the hallway without a heavily beaded bracelet or an id because then i focus on either too little or too much and i don\\x92t sleep nearly as much anymore i\\x92ve become a slight germaphobe not letting people sit on my bed or touch me or my food in any way and vise versa i get 5 hours of sleep each night tops accompanied by sleep paralysis i eat once or twice a day and i\\x92m always extremely tired with random bursts of energy like 3 times a day which i\\x92m starting to believe are manic episodes but i haven\\x92t been formally diagnosed with anything so i can\\x92t say for sure i have xenomelia in my left leg and i can\\x92t even explain why that accompanied by my mother saying that i should get a fresh start and switch over to another school is absolutely tearing me apart why back to the band thing\\ni live a life of hobbies and mellifluous pastimes and when i put them together the puzzle pieces don\\x92t fit the world reciprocates in some ways and in other ways it does absolutely nothing because the world moves on while i sit in this black sap that is my grades expectations and social life i often look at this quote  \\x93a star died to make you and you find no romance in that\\x94 it makes me question things quite a bit it\\x92s weird to think about at first it might make you feel special \\x93a star died to make me wow\\x94 but then you may realize that stars died to make everyone the quote is supposed to make you feel significant special but then you realize that everyone around was also created from stars just as you were it plays in uniqueness adults tell you all the time that there\\x92s only one of you nobody else is like you and that you are a unique individual capable of whatever you can possibly put your mind to in whatever moment it is that\\x92s true you are unique and you are capable of doing whatever your heart desires if you try hard enough with the right intentions and planned calculations anything is possible the thing that\\x92s wrong with that is that it applies to everyone the fact that everyone is unique simultaneously makes everyone the exact opposite of that we are all at heart the same look around yourself next time you\\x92re in public everyone has a life everyone has their own story the world doesn\\x92t revolve around you the opposite applies almost everyone on this earth has had their own dreams and ambitions at some point\\n i feel as if the people who were supposed to guide me to these places my parents my siblings and my friends haven\\x92t all been the best influences on me i compare my family to other families quite often families where their parents treat them like friends instead of trophy objects to show off on facebook and instagram parents that tell them good job im so proud of you on their report cards instead of asking them if they think they can get into college with their lowest grade being an 86 i think i would cry if my parents said that they\\x92re proud of me even once all that i want is some sort of sign from them that i\\x92m doing okay as some form of selfvalidation so that i can feel like i\\x92m not working my ass off for nothing it\\x92s small things that other people take for granted i dont think ive ever seriously contemplated it and maybe its just the existential dread but for the past year i think about killing myself and being done with life a lot im not an introvert and im very average looking and i feel like ive done nothing in life i havent worked hard enough im 21 and in 2nd year of college i shouldve worked harder gotten into a better college i feel like i disappointed everyone around me constantly when i look at my father i feel awful about myself that i never really made him proud i cant even think about finishing college idk why i feel like nothing in life is good anymore my college pretty much sucks im driving my friends away and i cant seem to do anything right im so fucking pathetic rn its insane i never signed up for this i hate it nothing makes me excited anymore i havent felt legitimately excited in so long\\nhi everyone i\\x92m 24 years old and my best friend and i have been friends since we were 10 he recently took his life and i am in pieces i feel like no one understands this overwhelming feeling so many emotions i can\\x92t fully comprehend it\\x92s been a month today i just want to talk to someone who knows wtf to say i\\x92m currently in a program and trying to focus in school and it\\x92s so difficult he helped me get into this program he would of wanted me to keep going it honestly feels like all his pain was transferred to me after he passed the only person i would talk to about these feelings and pain is gone people just tell me to create a schedule or go for a walk etc none of that will take this pain away my bestfriend and i would talk almost daily for years i\\x92m in shock after i got into the program and started living with my fiancé and his kids i got really busy so talking with him turned into every couple days or every week before he took his life we didn\\x92t talk for two whole weeks it breaks my heart why didn\\x92t we talk those two whole weeks it wasn\\x92t like us and i carry so much guilt for that why didn\\x92t he tell me i texted him a couple hours too late that day he told me before he was suicidal a year before he did it why didn\\x92t i get him help he said he was good i wish i pushed harder to get him help rather than thinking he had this or i could help him alone his family gave no support absent parents and not so loving guardians how stupid of me he was such a beautiful loving person i can\\x92t get out of bed it\\x92s so hard everyday it\\x92s so hard to get things done does anyone else not care about setting

settle another hurdle comes flying at me this month alone we found out my mum could be dying my girlfriend left me my parents revealed that they wanted a divorce my grandad was hospitalised again and just now my little sisters been rushed to ae with possible brain damage if there is a god up there they must fucking hate me it is like life is trying to get me to kill myself and honestly i think i would be better off dead i attempted when i was 12 but i was stupid and there was no way i could cut deep enough now i am 15 and everything is so much worse than it ever has been and i just cannot hold on much longer  it is going to take a miracle to get me through this i feel so alone i feel like the world hates me and i have no idea what i did wrong to deserve this i thought i was getting better i was doing so well and now everythings just come crashing down again i was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning but i highly doubt there is any way for me to get that it is looking like i will overdose but that is unreliable as fuck and surviving sounds like hell so idk just got to stick around long enough to make sure my sisters alright i have already contacted one of my exs friends to make sure they are looked after when i am gone i do not think there is long left for me sorry i have posted on this subreddit too many times in the span of a week and that is probably really annoying i just have absolutely no idea what to do anymore i feel sick if my sister dies then i really cannot do this anymore it all hurts life is really fucking trying me i am 20 year old with some good friends but i am just tired a had a problem with bullying when i was little and that hit me hard but the thing that annoys me the most is like all my friends succeeding in life without even trying like the relationship part without even wanting one and i just feel fucking jealous i am just fucking ugly and all i want is to find a person to lovei feel disgusted by myself that i am jealous of my friends and i just want to end it all but i just see my familys faces and i do not want to put them through this i feel i am playing my life on hard mode while everyone is on easy mode i just cannot do this anymore i am just tired it is looming around the corner again it always comes back like a wave like the moon i can hear the silence feel the breeze see the cold light death i try and try and try i choose and i survive then it hits again and everything goes dark suicide singing to me peace quiet end of everything resisting is difficult so very difficult just a bright white piece of string and it would be over peace quiet end i live with death it is always there it is looming around the corner there isfoodand other things i will be judged for and for having weird views because maybe i am delusional i want to go to jail life would be better there i am not joking maybe suicide would not even cross my mind in jail i am on zoloft and focalin and it is changed my life over the past four years for the better but this week i have been feeling like i am regressing a lot i do not have any interest in any activities i normally like my brain feels like there is a fog around it and i love my new job but i do not have the energy to perform as well my fiancee went out of town on tuesday as well which just made things worse i feel useless and tired and just like shit in general i think it is hitting extra hard because i have been doing so well for so long i would talk to my fiancee but she is been through so much with me that i cannot bear to put this on her i am just lost what am i doing wrong i just want to get back in my routine but idk shit sucks it is getting worse again i have really bad feelings but always when i try to look up something related to that on a forum or other website they quickly go to a god i dint want to hear about that stupid god but i always find a perspn who does that because of that i always quit the website and do sonething else stupid instead of searching for some comforting text why do so many people go to religion when they try to help someone with depression etc everyone in my schooling system thinks i am autistic but i really faked it so my school work would be easier i stopped going to school because i do not fit in there with anyone and nobody likes how different i am i have problems about my body i have a dent on my chest and it makes me so self conscious i cannot do anything that requires me to not wear a shirt or people laugh at me and call me an alien i have a gf but as of recently she is been loosing connection to me since she has her bestfriend back she does not want to be my bestfriend anymore i have some friends they are really nice but i do not think they understand me i think that my dad hates me because i am not the son that he wanted i feel like a disappointment to him and my family name because i am autistic and i have not gone to school for 3 years and i feel weak because i was molested and used when i was 10 i am 17 years old i do not have a job and i used to be a drug dealer 1 year ago just because i hated going to school when i was dealing i was addicted to mdma and xanax they have both helped heavily with destroying my views and how i see myself i have lost all of my happy emotions the only feelings that i feel is sadness and hatred to who i am i cry almost every day of every hour just because living in my body hurts my soul so much i do not belong on this planet or in this body i hope nobody feels the ways that i do it is a shit feeling i just needed to get this off my chest i am planning on trying dmt as i have experienced lsd over 30 times but i would just like to try it to see if it changes anything about myself and if it does not change me i do not want to live here anymore sorry for huge wall of text ik a lot of people on this subreddit probably do not actually care about anyone venting you all just care about punctuation and karma but i am doing it anyway i do not feel comfortable on this earth anymore and i want to die i have so many stressors in my life all major things that tear me down every day i fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world last night i finally broke after 33 years of a shit show of a life i am done what ultimately triggered this is that my son 7m with adhd has been expelled from holiday club i quit my job jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication he did brilliantly i however hated being a sahm and a carer the loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that i only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children so i started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law i got a job with a police department something for me and something where i will meet other adults without being attached to my children i got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months i have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour he has been kicked out and now i have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer i cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that i do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation i can go back on antidepressants i can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that i no longer have any autonomy over my life i am not a person any more i am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children i find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family i cannot work and now as it turns out i cannot even die i cannot leave behind my children i am their only parent i have no control in this life over anything i now think i am too far gone to ever feel happy again i want to die i cannot go back to groundhog day imagine waking up only hanging on by a thread and then you get a call from your bank that you lost 9000 to fraud from a possible job posting not to be dramatic but at this point i am convinced that life enjoys torturing me and i am not sure how much longer i can be it is joke i am lifes rag doll anyone know of a way that has no chance of failure is decently quick and is not a gun it would be much appreciated painless way except gun i feel like there is nothing left for me i cannot go to school again i cannot handle that again my entire life is about to change in a couple weeks and i just want it all to stop i want to die so bad it sounds quite stupid i know for the last couple of days i have prepared everything i need i will not bring the details but it is a very elaborate plan except one a note i started brainstorming and drafting what is useless and what is not decided whether to post or write by hand and checked for grammar but i felt like even my last piece of writing however short was not good enough nothing i do is ever good enough that is how it has always been i want to perfect something in my life and end myself in a grand finale yet i do not know perhaps i can give it another few days today is a new one i am planning to end it all but as a writer i keep editing my suicide note if i find out i have another illness on top of my epilepsy i will end my life i am done i am fucking done if i find out i have something else i am f21 i know it is pathetic to ask for help but i just want to talk and at least have a bit of hope that the future will be differentthe last days have been though and idk how it got to this now i want to kill myself i could talk to my friends but i do not want to worry them without actually trying it they have their lives and my problems feel just too stupid to put that burden on someone elses mind i do not want to bother anyonei do not know if this kind of posts is allowed here but all i see are hotlines from other countries and not mine venezuela so i do not know what else to do i just want to feel better and talk to someone that can offer some kind advice that would be nice i do not really want to kill myself but i feel it is the only way of getting rid of all my problems i just want to talk to somebody if i fail there is no more hope left for me in this shitty life it is going to be my 3rd attempt this year so i am seriously messed up and ready to go previously i gave up because it was too cold and i want to die in the wilderness this time i am better prepared i do not have much more strenght to mask my emotions 1 week then i gtfo i give myself 1 week to find a new job my life has always been a mess but now i am at a point where i do not have much energy left to go on any further every second is tormenting me i have made several mistakes that threw what is been left of me and my life completely off the rails and now i am devastated i do not have any perspectives whatsoever and self hate eats me what can i do nothing is fun anymore and i have no one it gets worse everyday people are trying to help me and they really do see what i am saying but they do not know how to help me either and they are professionals i am in mental hospitals most of the time but it does not help i do not know what to do anymore i feel horrible i have given up on life i hate my emotionally abusive parents i wish they just fucking divorced they are always arguing over literally everything they are always fucking insulting me every fucking day they are also overcontrolling af treating me like a fucking object and making me literally feel like i am physically and mentally suffocating every day i feel emptyuseless and hopeless every fucking day i wish i was aborted i am in uni but i have no fucking clue what i want to do with my life and i do not have anywhere near enough money to move outfucking sucks having to pretend to friends that i am fine when in reality i am constantly bawling my eyes out everyday because i think about killing myself everydayi wake up everyday wishing i died in my sleepi have tried so fucking hard to fight my depression but it literally has destroyed me i have got no fight left in me life just is not meant to be for me i have had enough yes it is necessary however it is not a cure and does not fix everything it does not fix trauma or trust issues when they are deeply ingrained because nearly everyone in your life abused and betrayed you it does not fix depression coping mechanisms only go so far you go to therapy you talk about it they give you coping mechanisms that trauma depression and anxiety supersedes and you have to trick yourself into having a positive mindset to the point where it is toxic or invalidating or bypassing very real issues sometimes i hate it if you do not have love support or an environment that is not triggering then sometimes therapy is not enough a recent kpop star attempted suicide and all i see in the comments are get therapy she needs professional help the presence of a therapist is only temporary even if they are a good one what about being home alone with your thoughts trust issues and depression what about feeling like you need to be held all the time there is no medium for that for christs sakes i am so sick of people telling people to get therapy than having to live my life the negative outweigh the positives the highs are not worth itit is been like this for years i have not become stronger i am still the same and still nobody gives a fuck because everyone is got problemswhy death seems a better option i have horrible ocd pureo and it constantly bothers me i cannot be happy for more than 10 mins a day i am miserable i cannot even kill myself because people would miss me i wish i could kill myself had a lot of little half assed attempts i did not really start or go far enough through but i did last night the other time was when i odd at 16was suffocating for an hour but i could not pass out just crying a lot at one point and writing out my thoughts my neck and shoulders hurt a lot and i keep feeling tingly and dizzy at points i really wanted to go to the er but it is scary you knowi have therapy later but i do not know if i will tell him a lot of awful stuff has been going on do not know if i can talk about any of it though it is not like he can help me he would probably have me shipped off somewhere where i will lose all my rights and probably be mistreated at best but likely molested and abused at worst and then i will not be able to get top surgery anymore because i am too cwazywish i could get like some kind of medication to get me through these shit things but i just get treated like a druggie for wanting something more intensive than shit ssristexts someone sent me today are just sending me even more over the edge nobody understands attempt 2 i have suicidal thoughts anger and i just do not care anymoreon edge from transitioning and transitioning genders getting angry at people attacking them verbally even physically if it got to that stage and just want to end it allas a coping mechanism i have posted to nsfw subreddits on an another account and cannot stop is this what my life has come to sometimes in my life wish i were invisible i am over eating my sleep schedule is erratic my room is a mess i am binging i am moving slow i am hurting myself my head is blank i have deep dark eye circles i am over spending i should have ended my life at april but my father is so selfish for getting the knife in my roomi need help help me stop please i am desperate i do not know if talking can help but i do not think it can it never does i am alive but not living  general narcissist venting feel free to comment if you wantthe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide i mean of course they would care people even care when strangers die the initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing but i think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that the only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying what five times in a row because my hearing is goingbut the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that i know i cannot be i want to make something of myself but i just i cannot i have nothing to put on my resume i cannot do taxes there is so many obvious things that other people know that i just do not and nobody thinks to tell me because i should already know why do not i already know basic crap why did i spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child why cannot i take care of myself without burning out if i brush my teeth shower get dressed and do my hair routine all in the same day then i am burnt out that is it i cannot do anything else for the day i am too tired there is no way i could work or get a job like this i would burn out after one task and get fired i hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how i am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that i am the best i hate that my self esteem is based on other peoples approval but unlike other narcs i do not get approval because i am literally shit at everything so i am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything i hate that i even told anyone that i am a narc of course they would not accept me what the hell was i thinking what kind of idiot would expect anything different things are not going to get better for the npd community not in my life time atleast well maybe that will be another reason to stay alive imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their npd recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma experiencing something i could not maybe when i am in my 80s and my mom my poor mom she has to pay for everything because i cannot do shit on my own physical therapy regular therapy medication my food i hate this you should not have to take care of me you should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working you should be doing your hobbies and i should be the one buying you things maybe i will get to the point of recovery where i am not so selfcentered and then i can finally let go and they can all finally live their lives i wish i was not such a narc so i could just find peace in death started volunteering at a local animal shelter i feel better not happier i still really hate myself but i think i can push forward i want to start painting and drawing to express myself i know il start eventually days just blend in i have been so disconnected with the world my family and myself for the past few years i do not know what my face looks like i see it in a mirror but cannot picture that is actually me my dad talked about me as a child and i cannot picture that happened i was never a child i never existed nothing does idk how to talk to my family friends and even little sister who i was so close with idk what to do disconnected i feel like nothing everyday i wake up and ask why am i alive and why did not i die in my sleep i mean almost nothing to most members but of society so if i offd myself people would forget about me after using my name for publicity after 3 dayswhen you die people only care then use your name for clouttired of living a life i did not ask for i have no goals no motivation i live in a bum ass town encompassed in a shitty county with no opportunities people tell me no excuses but i do not care i am not as strong as everybody and being a man they expect you to suck it up and hold it in but in reality i just rather off myself or die in my sleep on the edge and probably about to write my final note i have called the samaritans i used to contact childline and i cannot go counselling or to my family or to my school they will contact safeguarding n ill be placed in a mental hospital i want to commit but ill feel guilty but then i do not want to continue when i die i will not feel guilt i will not have memories or any worries so peaceful i am going to do it i am so sick and tired of not being able to do anything the right way first my ex broke up with me then alot of my friends started ignoring me and now i just do not have the energy to do much and the stuff i want to do i cannot do correctly and its a stupidly easy thing id rather not mention i am really really tired of trying anymore i do not have a clue what i am doing anymore content warning please do not read this post if you are suicidalprone to suicidal thoughts i do not want to trigger a negative spiral for anyone elsei am 19m from turkey my family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues i have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me i have a very sensitive temperament am very neurotic and introverted i am somewhat bright academically not a genius but significantly above average have no hobbies or social life ever since the age of 13 i have been severely depressed and isolatedi know maany people have it much harder than me and i am somewhat in a privileged demographic but i really need to vent without holding back living in turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime and even if i want to migrate i will be met with some degree of prejudice because i am a middle easterner i do not want to leave my country ideally too but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape i am not religious believe life is meaningless those are not the reasons behind my depression though i do not give a shit about life being meaningless because i know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case the problem is i cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying memy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls i have gone through many rejections only to deduce thata my need for approval is making me unattractiveb i am not goodattractivesociable enough for women to take notice of me want meof course nobody tells those to my face they are rather the constant messages i come across reading dating advice blogs psychological studies on attraction etc it is even more depressing when dating intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition and even more depressing that i have no satisfying counter arguments against that i too can see that this is all just a competition but some of us me included are not comfortable admitting i remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists how they talk about everyone is trying to get the best deal they can and you may be miserable as an 8 since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you dating is a market and i just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1 as a malei know suicide if done right would be the same as falling asleep just not to wake up i know painless ways and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living i have a very painful daily lived experience and i just wish for the pain to go away but it persists there is always an unfulfilled need for love and it is veery hard to fulfill that need and i do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled and mind you i have been trying very hard to be social my temperament is just too apparenti am going to wait for my therapy sessions i just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away and it will not i may decide on killing myself a year later if i feel the same way and things did not change i am considering suicide i have been through hell and back just to be myself lost my extremely abusive birth family in the process who never accepted that they had a daughter instead of a son anyway accidentally found out about a ton of memories from my childhood and i just do not want to be in all this pain i cannot work bc my stupid brain does not function properly especially around other people and i am running out of food i started therapy but idk how long it will take to get better and i am just hurting so much i should not have to deal with all this pain just bc i was born in the wrong body and to the wrong family it is just not fair it does not feel like things will get better for me i have not been suicidal for awhile a good 34 months i am still living with my parents and my mom keeps all pills  other things i could use to hurt myself in her room she fills up a pill container for a few days no more than 4 at a time and will not let me take more atarax which i need throughout the day so i have to ask her continuously she also does not think i should take much even though the safe amount is way more than i take everydaybasically i do not get why i am trying if nothing is changing i attempted my worst attempt about a year ago i am about 5 months clean from self harm and am not suicidal when does the trust come back i understand she is scared that is valid but i will not grow at all if i am kept under lock  key forever why am i trying a week ago i was fine now all my friends hate my guts and i cannot go outside because i have fuckhbg covid if the virus does not kill me then i sure as hell will do its job for it my life has gone downhill so fast why am i so stupid i fell for someone who cannot love me back loving him hurts so much but i do not know how to stop i know he will not be in my life forever and when he starts college i will not have much chance to see him anymore i really do not want us to just slowly drift apart and stop talking i do not want to be alone i already have nothing to live for and if hes gone as well there will not be anything worth staying alive for i hate myself for loving someone throwaway account because god forbid anyone who actually knows me sees thisi am just tired and it does not even feel worth it anymore it just feels so futile and hopeless to stay alivei was diagnosed with adhd depression and binge eating disorder in february i am on medication and yet i am still fucking up a lot i am still late for work on occasion i am still having a hard time getting things done around the apartment i keep telling myself that i will do good things like cook healthy food and wake up and take walks and wash my face from this point forward but it never happens or i do it for a day or 2 and cannot keep it upbefore i thought what my family said was true and i am just lazy but i cannot function without medication and what is the point of living a life where i need medication and i am still having trouble getting it together anyway i would rather be dead than wasting air and peoples time i wish i was dead i have been going through a lot lately and all i can think of is taking my own life all i feel is pain and depression and i am honestly not sure if i really want help or just for everything to end i need help i feel worthless and nowhere near a man i feel weak and think that i would be better off dead i have messed up relationships and family relationships by doing dumb shit and saying things i should not have said i have been forgiven for my actions but i know thing will not ever be the same again i have always been that burden and i just hate myself i do not even know what i want to do with my life i went to college and could not even go through my first semester and dropped out i am in student debt because of that then i went to the military and realized i could not do it i just feel like me being here is pointless i do not know what to do and i am scared for my future i know my family is disappointed in me for the military thing but they just hide it my girlfriend has been here through the whole ride and has supported me but i feel like my luck will run out with her soon i do not know why she has not left me yet i know she loves me but she deserves better if i am being honest i just want to end it but something is holding me here and i do not know what it is i know people go through worse things and i do not mean to bitch but all this pain is building up i do not know who to talk to about suicide and i do not want to seem like i am going crazy any advice or help  if you are reading this i am glad you are still here i do not know why i am still here i just do not want to be alive anymore the constant hurt and pain is too much to bare i do not know what the point is anymore i really do not life feels dark and empty i do not have the strength or the will to be here anymorei wake up and feel like i cannot breath a deep sadness washes over mean emptinessa black hole withinhow can i live feeling like this its only going to get worse what is the point when i was younger in my childhood i had self worth i still had anxiety but i felt like i was the best at everything i was a gifted child and did well in school in fact my only main source of anxiety was if my crush liked me back either way i felt special and unique i have had worrying behavior before where i would cut myself with school scissors and even younger as a toddler i would bang my head against the wall or floor still those things were rare of me though maybe i should i have taken it as a sign of things to come in middle school i was anxious but i still felt nice and special 9th grade was when things changed though i started to get bullied which made me reevaluate myself i started seeing myself in a negative light and the only way i coped was sleep or being in a constant state of self loathing there were times i made threats to the students that were bullying me but instead of thinking it was wrong i doubted my capabilities to go through with the threat after 9th grade i felt better going to another high school i was not getting bullied and even though i was not quickly making friends people still let me hang around them or sit at their table it was nice i met my ex boyfriend not too long after and we stayed together for 3 years he ended up leaving me during my first semester of college i felt sad about it but having been in a relationship for 3 years gave me a false sense of security that finding another relationship might be easy i was quite wrong not only that but i started to realize many people were better than me and were skilled at something while i realized i was not i was quite literally not good at anything or at least not good enough however this world requires you to contribute something to it i could not the former gifted child felt lied to that i could do anything and i had great potential it bothered me a lot i did not feel like i could conquer anything like i used to instead i was smacked in the face with the truth that i was not special and my best was not good enough through this period people kept telling me to keep trying and i eventually will get good i did not see any improvement in some areas i felt like i was getting worse right now i am stuck with the feeling of inferiority and suicidal thoughts i am not quite doing anything for this world in a way i feel like i am taking up space that could be used for a much more skilled and intelligent individual recently i looked through documents of tests that were done when i was younger in elementary school i found that i lacked critical thinking skills and had a language disorder as well as anxiety i thought my iq may have been better but i tested below average for verbal iq and only slightly above average for non verbal with the highest in calculating right now i am not sure how to move forward but i am too scared to kill myself i have never been good enough  i want blood all over my body i want it draping over everything and anything in my hair everywhere never let the world forget slice slice i do not really want to commit suicide walking through it in my head and visualizing being in the moment where i take my life is really unpleasant i think some of us just want to be somewhere far from here without overwhelming thoughts and problems that never end with people or at the least someone that is a true friend far from a world that gives kids cancer and hurts the innocent selfless peoplesadness and general dissatisfaction is not a bad thing they are key to understanding what it means to be happy but not like how it is right now with no room to breathe far from here i am only 16 and i cannot do snot thing right i am stupid compared to everyone around me i am fat like really fat i have no skills academically or physically and cannot find the will to actually do anything or get skills i can actually use anywherei am effectively incapable of being aware of my surroundings and kind of just get lost in my own head all the timei am not funny and all my friends up until not too long ago have left me one way or another or just straight up ignored me i am that weird pit stop people make from one point to another i am a side character in even my own storymy family keeps telling me to just get better loose weight study but than provide no help once my great grandmother pop and what not die and my current friends one at lunch leave who will i have my mom who keeps putting me down and screaming at me for the slightest inconvenience to her my dad who i barely see my little siblings and cousins i do not care if they will miss me in enough time they will forget me like everyone else doesthe only people who truly care talk about me behind my back i have no mental stability i am self conscious to the point of it being crippling i have no skills or knowledge on how to get a job nor a reliable path i can take for a career i am just another voice in the crowdnothing but a sad pile of memorys stick in the past i can do dnd but it feels like everyone is life is moving forwards but mine and i am stuck in the past nobody can make time anymoreif i die world anyone care what can i do i feel like a mistake and nobody cares never thought i was going to make it this far i am not perfect i am not who i want to be but i am content with being alive right now i wanted to thank everyone on this sub i love you all so much i am alive to be 18 seriously do not know how to title this but ironicof course its splendidwish i was never been born the more i live this life then more painful it islets see beginning that i am born ugly as in ugly ugly i was born with such ugly face it hurts to have crushmy eyebrows looks like always frowning so people always think i am stupid my ear infection since birth makes me deafimmune system is so bad i am mentally and socially retarded the more i think of it the more i realized i am not meant to be bornfun thing is when i die the only people that will kept calling me are my bills nobody else willnone of my so called friends messaging me or calling me daily to see if i am all right i mean my family will probably do try to call me but by the time they do find out i am already rotten in my room so i am trying not do that i just think of crashing my car in the open freeway or crashing on tree so nobody else will get hurtthat or ill just jump into the hill hopefully just die i do not know i fucking hate this life stupid stupid splendid life i have never hurt a child before i have not hurt a child now and i will never hurt a child in the future the thought of having sex with a child or teenager disgusts me and i would never hurt a kid like that but i feel i have to accept that i am attracted to them it hurts me to say this it has hurt me so much when i questioned myself about it in the past but i have to accept it i cannot be around children with out a sexual thought coming in my mind for some sort of desire even if it is something i find so repulsive and wrong to come i just need to accept that i am disgusting and that i am probably better off dead than a danger to children i truly do not think i have a future if i am going to have these desires towards youth i guess i should just get it over with i think i am a pedophile can eating shoe polish lead to death  question i did not think id make it to my twenties but here i am and i wonder if it would have been better off if i did not you put out fires but new ones just crop up i hope the first funeral i attend is my own i often feel the only way to make people take my depression and possible underlying causes seriously is to actually kill myself especially family who i feel are supportive in some ways but downplay my depression they do not take it seriosuly when i say i cannot handle work and life a certain family member is the worst stating before that i just get a little down sometimes that phrase still makes me want to punch a wallor that he notices others inc himself feeling depressed in winter or that he had trouble keeping a job when he was younger he gives terrible advice that just makes me angry do not feel you cannot take a vacation that does not solve the problem of the actual job i am sick of being minimizedi feel and maybe i am wrong its just minimizing my condition i mean hes supportive in other ways but i am still angry and i feel killing myself is the only way to win the argument i feel having failed at anything in life the only i can have the final word or any control is to kill my self  successfully a failed attempt will only make me more of a failure i mean i know there has to be a better way to deal with this i just do not know how confrontation will not help ill just sound more desperate staying my true feelings about everything to everyone will not help ill just embarrass and maybe isolate myself more i can discuss with a counsellor but that often just feels like talking its not an solution its not even leading to one people only take action especially irreversible violent action seriously how to make people take your condition seriously without having to kill yourself  i cannot do anything about my race i can change my weight or my appearance to some extent but what do i do about my race the moment i tell some guys my race they act badly with me i do not know what to do except cry i wish i could kill myself in a way that it does not hurt my family but it is impossible i feel trapped racism just makes me want to kill myself i am in constant physical pain and i just want it all to stop my joints hurt so bad all the time and i cannot do anything about it sometimes i can barely fucking walk i cannot do this anymore i am so tired of living like this i am so tired i am so tired of life i am so tired of being here i am so tired of living every single day i ask god why the hell did you create me i hate myself if i killed myself no one would care i do not know what to do anymore i am planning to kill myself soon i wonder if i can finally just die i am so tired is it normal to cry and think of suicide when ur dad yells at you sometimes i say in my mind maybe if i did not exist he would not have any problems his life would be better without me etci try to prove to him that i am not useless but in the end i will never satisfy him i am crying as i write all this any tips to deal with these thoughts earlier this week i heard that a casual friends father committed suicide and i am having a hard time processing it from the outside looking in he seemed to have a good life great wife and kids beautiful grand babies very successful and wealthy very supportive and loving familyhis whole family had gone on a trip and he had stayed behindwhen they returned they found him and he had shot himself in the head i am so sad to hear this because he was in such a dark and painful space to kill himself and having his family find him i hope he found the relief and peace he was seeking suicide of my friends dad i am thinking about ending it all this life is too full of sadness and pain i just do not see the point it trying to continue i do not have the strength energy or will to be in this world anymore i just see darkness ahead of me i want it to end i need to go soon but i am a pussy of course is this if done correctly will this be fast successful and fairly painless i cannot keep pushing on it feels like my soul is being burned slowly to increase the suffering is the exit bag the least painful do you think if you were born in another era you would be happier different time period does anyone know how i can make it the next couple of days i am basically all by myself for the first time ever and single after 8 years because i suspected my partner of cheating with some barely legal teenage girl my mom says i should start feeling a lot better after a few days when the initial shock of everything wears off so how can i get myself to survive until then i have a lot of other mental health issues and trauma and that coupled with something like this is just pushing me over the edge advice please i can bet nobodys going to read this or see this at all and i can also predict that if somehow miraculously it does people will become concerned over me despite not knowing me and my demons and sins in the slightest claiming that they know better and that this stupid excuse of life is worthwhile when of course it is not \\u200beveryone is stuck in their own labyrinth they have built for themselves and have had others built too the fucking inane pointless childish and fickle way that this universe decides to rule over life and manage it is sickening and embarrassing \\u200bthere is no damn use for it at all and i despise every single aspect of it \\u200bwe are only united by our ignorance and that is all \\u200bevery passing day it is become increasingly apparent yet harder somehow to see \\u200bthere is one thing for certain and that is

as my life will fade away into the dust from when we once came all i ask is for no responses or votes please \\u200blet this fall into the void i will eventually have to jump into or fall alongside this abomination i am this post does not matter nor do i everytime i go on this subreddit i cannot help but feel like i am just being a whiny brat everyone else has some truly terrible things that happened to them i can understand why they want to do something like this but me i just dealt with bullies all throughout elementary school and was molested for a bit when i was ten i should still be functional by all accountsand yet i am starting to fail out of school because i was a lazy shit all throughout the year who panicked at the prospect of talking to people and slept all day i am just wasting everyone is time and money at this point i do not really know why i am still here maybe it is time to quit before i can disappoint anyone else even more than i already have i already know i am not going to see my late twenties so why not end early overreactions god this world is just fucked with the economy making it so hard for poor people to become wealthy and terrible rich people staying rich by garbage companies that we cannot stop supporting because we need their products i do not want to become an adult and have to live in this cesspool and no major political people do shit because they are shit i cannot do shit because i am a failure ah fuck man the longer i go the more i come to reality that maybe this is it ill just have to get over it and become another worker in a society that does not care and instead idolizes human garbage do what you love and enjoy life while i do not hate people who say that and instead wish them the best for wanting to do what they love its just impossible to do what you enjoy without having this huge fucking wall that stops you because ironically you need money to do we have a whole planet to explore and even the whole solar system and other major discoveries waiting to be found and yet were stopped by stupid people that cannot get over the fact that someone is not the same race sexuality or gender as them and here i am on reddit ranting about a dogshit world because that is all i can do its too difficult to have a voice in this world so all i can do is post on a subreddit that probably will not even get noticed fuck this world man this world is so shit but we cannot do anything about it my girlfriend f16 attempted to od intentionally luckily i contacted the police and they were able to get to her on time she is in the hospital right now i do not know how to cope i keep imagining her lifeless in a casket and i break down harder and harder i do not want to be selfish and prevent her from the help she needs i just do not know what to do moving forward she cuts she has several clinically diagnosed mental health disorders her family situation sucks and she is ran away from home several times already i try my best to be there for her i am just lost right now my girlfriend attempted suicide today do you regret not committing suicide for all the people who wanted to kill themselves but never did it did your life improved life is boring i am not doing anything interesting or memorable whatsoever sucks that my first year of highschool was wasted too tbh this whole thing has taken over my life because when anything little goes wrong i think abt killing myself and i think abt sh and all that very often and i am literally never happy anymore also sucks that my parents are not understanding at all so not like i could tell them believed stupid sh lie and my mom was denying it like not my daughter and i have no way of getting help and i know people get trauma from going to mental facilities so i know i cannot tell anyone so i am kind of stuck staying miserable lol like a dead end and i have accepted the fact that i am just a lesson for people who did not see my signs or whatever not really blaming them for not seeing them tho lol honestly i know i am wasting my teen years away did your life improved after deciding not to kill your self to all the people who wanted to kill himself but did not did your life improved after anyone else feel this way i am beyond blessed but it took a while to get here i suffer from ptsd anxiety and depression i am about to child of an immigrant to america and my father was born in the usa he passed in 95 of a heroin overdose and my mother is still an alcoholic same story as everyone else green up in foster care aged out kind of found my way found a phenomenal husband great career and i still can help but think about suicide daily i have no active plans or thoughts but some days are just so damn difficult lt to proceed i want to die but i do not it is almost time for my final tour it kind of reminds of when i inititially tried to do this vacation almost 18 months ago i was supposed to go on this trip in march of 2020 i was to leave on a saturday and on friday i had to cancel because everything including the hotels shut down i had to cancel the day before my trip actually day of as i was on the phone for that long trying to cancel and recoup everything now here i am about to head on the tour i was supposed to have and 2 days before i am about to leave all mandates are back on i am not against this at all it is just funny that the eve i am about to go again and all things are on the verge of being cancelled i waited till everything opened to make sure i could do everything and what do i get for my patience the eve before i am to go mandates back oni think i said this in the first post but regardless of whether this trip happens or not i am killing myself and if i cannot go it makes sense since it will be exactly how my entire life has been with dissapointment if i can go i guess i can just sit in my hotel room alot go out get food to bring back to my room and eat it cold makes sense actually fits my lifeso close but never quite there if i go if i do not by the end of august i would say read my obituary but there will not be one or if there is it will just be he lived and now he is not i cannot begin to tell you how angry unhappy and frustrated this news makes me maybe a good time would get me out of my funk bit its just more dissapointment think i would be used to it by now this one just stings me alot more my whole body feels empty now it is like you know when you are really hungry and you stomach feels like it is sucking inside you my whole body feels like that my arms legs toes fingertips everything on me feels empty and it is a weird and uncomfortable sensation i am almost tingling but not good tingling tingling that is excruciating and it is not painful it is all in my headfuck my life man fuck my fucking life forever unhappy 04 now i am stuck and i have to do a job that does not give a living wage and keep paying my bills till the day a die i would rather quit i am 20 and deciding living upto 70 to experience this shit sucks people have kids only so that they can have someone to take care of when they are old the world is collapsing and i want to collapse with it i want to see the world burn i just hope there are no humans on earth covid should mutate and wipe out every human on this planet collapsing the society is the only way to save the planet i asked my mother why she brought me into this cruel world she said if i did not have kids then the society would shame me i have daydreamed about suicide every day since i was 12 i started getting depressed at way younger than that but i would say the fantasies started around middle school back when i was in school i would zone out in class and make all fs because i was constantly daydreaming it went all through middle and high school and now that i am an adult with a job i do it at work to imagining the goriest death for myself all throughout my youth i would use chatrooms and forums dedicated to people planning to commit suicide i really thought i would not make it to 16 but here i am at 21 ending my own life is the only real dream or goal i have ever consistently had what am i waiting on how old am i supposed to be when i do it i just hope its not much longer what am i waiting for every time i mention that i want to kill myself or that i want to die to people that are close to me i am always met with the there are better days ahead think of all the things you have not experienced i do not know but a part of me just does not care like yeah there are beautiful places to explore and countries i have not yet been to butat the end of the daytheyre just countries they are just places they are justexperiences i do not know how to explain it its just i do not care anymore the only thing that is holding me back is my family and maybe that makes me care but i just do not care about myself i have not cared about myself for so long and it makes me not care about dying or anything that happens in my life i just do not want to live i wish i never existed there is nothing i want to live for i have literally no one and i am just so fucking tired i do not want to be here anymore i am trying to decide if i should kill myself or not i am tired of people saying oh do not die your life matters my life has never mattered and in the long run it never will i work for 8 an hour and all of my friends have moved away i am single as fuck and i always have been when i meet new people i put on a smile and fake it but i am not enjoying hearing about how popular others are how much money they are making their amazing careers and no sign of the existentialism that plagues me every day of my miserable life it must feel good to be like everyone elsei am at my cousins house and she is happily married with an amazing job that pays six figures and she has tons of friends if i could have a fraction of that life all i wanted to do was be an artist and i cannot even do that now the magic has faded for me people tell me its not worth it and i should be chasing the money in stem where i can do art on the side i wish they would shut up i have never had a stroke of good luck in my life and since i was 17 i wished i would die seven years later and nothing is better i hope in the next seven years that i will not exist anymore the worst part is that i am too chicken to kill myselfnone of us really matter in the long run in 100 years nobody will remember who you are i look ugly i suck at everything i always fuck everything up i have no talent i cannot sing cannot dance cannot draw etc i just keep getting yelled at and i have an annoying voice hell i do not have friends nobody loves me i am single and i am most likely going to die alone why i am i still here i do not have any redeeming qualities is there anyone on this subreddit who ran from their problems when you were younger and then it overwhelmed you until you became suicidal my biggest regret is not facing my fears and problems like if i would have dealt with my problems when i was younger i would be ok with my life i never did until now but the consequences of running is almost impossible to live with i do not want to die without trying to win i might not have enough time to have a life that satisfies me if anyone can relate i would like to read about it running from problems i adopted a kitten hoping if i could live for something and something could live for me id be happy but i am so sad so so sad i told everyone it made me happy they helped pay for thembut it did not i just feel more stressed out i cannot see a away out of this i have to take care of them now i cannot leave them or anything i have always been like this i cannot see a future were i could be happy i just spewing my sadness out i doubt anyone comes to this place i thought getting a kitten would make me happy i am 23 virgin dropped out of college most likely will end up dropping out of my diploma that i sought for 5 years depression really makes it impossible to concentrate basically i am a failure in every singe way imaginablemy parents kept telling me to kill myself and how much of a worthless burden i am everyday ever since i was 12 and even knowing it probably was not true it is now though a part of me did believe it and it just kind of adda upi have been thinking about suicide everyday when i am bored i fantasize about dying and i cannot take it anymore my parents think i am lazy good for nothing and will probably kick me out on the streets soonmy head literally hurts i often feel a tight knit in my chest and i have lost my appetite for a few months i have also lost two cats in a short span of time because i was weak myself could not afford a doctor and parents to save a few bucks took them to a cheap back alley doctor i truly did love the cats more than anything and would have done absolutely anything in my pathetic power they trusted me loved me more than my scumbag parents and guess what they are deadi feel like a walking destructive force that will destroy anything and everything around me including myself but clearly not enough i am also afraid of holding others back and hurting them wasting their time on my miserable selfwhen the fuck does it get better i have been listening to it for a decade can it even get better it is such snake oil bullshit i cannot even kill myself because either it is painful too complicated or involves potentially traumatizing others like jumping in front of a trainhow do people live such hollow husk of lives can someone suggest an easy enough way to end my life i would strangle myself as a baby if i could i just want to fucking disappear i am so sorry i just feel so helpless and think i have managed to fuck my life up beyond repair it does not get better does it i do not know i am too tired to type a long paragraph i want loosing weight to be over with i can feel the fat all over my body the feeling of so much food in my stomach feels disgusting and dirty i just want the cycle to stop and i want to hit the goal weight i have been trying to reach for 3 years i was 4 pounds away and now i just feel disgusting if i binge one more time i am killing myself i am too depressed to kill myself i do not have the strength to get out of bed and start projects to try and keep my mind off my mind i am just putting back suicide to help my girlfriend not lose a loved one geeze fuck i wish i was not so much of a damn coward about it so many times i wish i could get it over withjust do not really want to put my mom through that also do not want to risk my school loans being dumped on herdo not entirely trust that my own death would be the end of iti always chastise myself about feeling like this that my stupid issues are not anything compared to the suffering many go throughyet that logic goes out the window when stress causes my anxiety to feel like it is ripping and clawing at my throat that for everything i try to do to actually be useful to others almost always seems to backfire one way or another like a constant reminder that i am always going to be worthless that it is the punishment i deserve for even being bornthat it is my own fault for even trying in the first place or my own fault for not being able to ignore the pain in my back and knees more so i could push myself to just fucking do better i mean why should i care if i ruin my body now i barely expected myself to make it this far to live this long i mean eventually even cowardice will reach its own breaking point i imagine constant reminders of failure and uselessness ramming against the dam will because it to shatter at some point a meaningless existence like mine is surely destined to fizzle out soon enough i just wish my death would not be as much of a burden as my life has beenhow nice it would be to just pop away to erase my debts and traces of my life as if i was never here to begin with i know so many people fear the very idea of the end but at this point i am either numb to the aspect of it or almost in a way dream of that time finally coming i mean i could remember a time dreaming of what it might be like to finally be better to find the joy and wonders of lifewhich i mean i can appreciate and all but there is also this sort of tarnish that constantly smudges everything when you have to live like this that nothing can ever be good for too long that things that bring you down have to roll over again and again until you just stop fighting and just become the punching bag that everything seems to zero in on and maybe that is what the idea of death inviting in it is own way that once you enter that dark abyss there just is not anything anymore no terrible things to constantly remind you of how worthless you are no good things that always perks up that joy and hope no matter how in vain you know it is just waiting for them to be ripped away again like they always arejust a peaceful empty where i can fade away into nothing where i can stop being a burden to everyone around me but until then i guess i will just have to stick to dreaming a mistake of a life are not your teen years supposed to be more interesting feels like i am wasting them lmao life is so boring i do not know why but whenever i try to get better i always find more self destructive habits and find new things about myself that i am disgusted and disappointed by and i would have killed myself by now if it was not for knowing what guilt i would leave with my family but now i am thinking that it is the only way out of this sick and disgusting world i guess i am here again i live with my dad and he does not love me hes been threatening to kick me out since i was 12 i am still under 18 for a few years so i cannot even move out yet i told my mom i am angry at her for leaving me with him and for even giving birth to me and she compared me to my dad my siblings all moved out a long time ago and barely talk to me noone ever helps me i am tired of being told to stick around for a while and it will get better i am tired i have been looking for ways of painless suicide and the only thing i can find is locking myself in my running car in the garage or finding a big cliff somewhere and jumping i regret being born i am currently 16 53 right now and if i do not grow any inches then i guess there is no point in living i mean why would i want to live as a short guy until i die fuck that i am going to kill myself on june 8 2023 if i am still short this evening like 2 hours ago i planned my suicide i planned where i was going to do it and a few days ago i planned the day that i was going to do it this friday but almost 30 minutes ago after i washed my face and cleaned my hair i feel amazing about myself this happens every day i get really suicidal because i loose my plans for the future and because i am very self conscious about my looks to the point where i have tried to cut my nose to make it look better but failed this lasts for about 90 percent of the day but then at around 10 percent of the day usually occurring at night i feel like i am beautifal and that i feel amazing about myself but i still do not see my future for myself as i lost most of my hopes and hobbies but that does not make me feel any less worst during those times of the day i have been diagnosed with depression before but i lied to my therapist because i did not want to get in trouble with my parents and told her i was ok so in her and my parents eyes it looks to me that i am getting a ton better they think i am doing better because i get hella good grades and the best grades out of all my siblings despite having depression but i am not my suicidal tendencies have gotten worst this month and this month i have gotten extreme low self esteem from seeing others on social media does anyone know what is going on i need help like rn a greeting to family and friendsapologize for doing this without getting help first or reaching out to try to fix thistry to explain the reasons for my actionsconfess any secretsinstructions for what to do after my death no funeral moving on etct but not till tomorrow you got a new phone and do not have my number you should have reached out what the actual fuckwhat does that even meani have told you what i wantoverand overand overif you want to break up with me just fucking do itbecause i am about to do iti cannot fucking do this anymorei have fucking had enoughyou are treating me like shiti mean it when i said that on your voicemailyou fucking areand i am sick of ithow am i supposed to sleep you have just put my anxiety through the roofbut you do not give a shiti have treated you like a precious diamond and then you just sweep me under the rug like dirti cannot believe i fucking trusted youi am so fucking hurtso fucking hurtlet me die aloneyou should see the thoughts going through my headi cannot do this anymore we need to talk i have decided that on august 13th 2021 i will take my own life i will jump from the top floor of a hospital parking garage i hope it works august 13th 2021 i am currently in the middle of my mom and aunts talking about the new covid variant and how there is going to be more lockdowns and schools are going to stay closed and they are all seemingly fine with it meanwhile i am over here freaking out because this is my trigger i have gone through so much during 2020 and even though i am a relatively strong person i have relapsed into depression active suicidal ideation and self harm as well as terrible sleep schedules i average on 4 hours a night i literally cannot do this anymore and i know ill freak and do something irreversible if i need to be isolated again the best part is that all of this makes me feel super selfish and guilty because it feels like i am prioritizing my happiness over other peoples lives anyone else going through the same i cannot go through another quarantine i was a normal good looking guyteennot bragging not like i was a playa or anything but my looks was not a concern i had active social life and would do things without thinking going parties nights out friends etcof course lockdown now but this been a few yearsin early 20s i notice my hair falling out i started using sun beds and tanning without suncream because i thought it i go bald i need look dark as white people look sick when baldmy idea was to burn my skin so it is permanently darkfast forward a few years not only is my once luxiourios long thick hair half disappeared my face looks like a burns victim i stopped the sun bathing due to this this my skin is white anyway the irony but all saggy and scarred qnd aged fant even hide it with my long hair as i have no long hair so my face is fully visible now so combine this with my thin receding hair i have gone from looking like a boy band teen to i am going to some hideous creaturewhen we people take pics when i have to go out work or family etc restarts they always upload pics without me the ones with me do not go on facebook etcit is obvious they do not want my fuked up face on social media and i do not blame themnow the issue as a result before covid i avoid everything no spontaneous life anymore going out for 2 or 3 days in a row random parties or nights out i just became a reclusei need to always carry or wear a hat i couosnt dare sleep over some place now i live in constant fear over my looksi hoped lockdown would make me feel less missing out as everyone same boat and time to avoid sun use creams fix my skin improve diet hope hair improvebut over 18 months my hair is worse and face not look any betterwell nobody is going out anyway with covid round here but i still feel my life is fuked because i had it alli looked normal and had social fun life now i am just constant obsessing and looking mirror qns almost cryingi cannot even look mirror anymore to soul destroying only in dim lightsi cannot believe only some years ago my skin was perfect and hair amazing longof course hair loss can happen but i see people grandparents with still nice skin so that is all my stupid fault qnd cannot improve itdepresses me every dayi eat well workout in good shape i gueas etc but all seems pointless is it stupid to be suicidal due to appearance i have been trying to understand what that compulsion is i felt when i wanted to die i know this is a tricky question because it would be so deeply personal and individual to everyone but i am curious if anyone can lucidly explain everything going on during this momentfor me all i remember was there was many terrible things happening to me and i was trying to just go about my regular day and as i was travelling in my wheelchair i stopped my head was telling me that i needed to drive onto the highway and go in front of the trucks that we are approachingi just froze and sat in that feeling and those thoughts crying trying to understand what it all was i had idolised about death and thought about it a lot but that was the first moment where my instincts were telling me to go and do it there and thenis this similar to everyone else just a spiralling of terrible thoughts and realisations leading to the strong desire to die or are there other nuances to it what is in that moment all my life my family has been toxic and i have always suffered from depression and severe anxiety i started cutting around the time i entered middle schooli turned 19 a month ago but for the past 3 years everything has gotten worse my older sister emotionally and verbally abuses me and my family she used to say once i turned 18 she would fight me i thought about killing myself just to avoid everything but i did not and now i am 19 i do not want to really get into details but believe me when i say the past 3 years have been hell i am exhaustedmy sister would threaten our lives and her own using everything she could against us we kicked her out many times but she let us herself back in the police have been to my house thousands of times i know she struggles with mental issues and she is in pain too but now i am exhausted and my depression and anxiety have worsened i have recently turned to drugs i am abusing them so badly everyday i get high if i can drink ill get wasted i have also recently started having sneaky links to feel something the first time i cried while doing stuff because i know its wrong but i also just do not carei am self destructing and the worst thing is i am witnessing myself do it and i cannot stop it i have become so numb to the world around meand when i am actually happy i feel guilty because i know my mom and the kids are sad with the situationi have wanted to move out but if i do i am leaving them behind to deal with my sisterwell i guess either way id be leaving themi do not want to die but i am tired of waking up to this numb feeling i have medication but i think need something stronger now lately i have been having cutting urges i am just so lost i do not know what to do anymore somebody pleasehelp me my intrusive thoughts have never been this bad i do not know if i can do this anymore and i am scared i am going to end it i am scared i am going to kill myself i just want to die fighting for something in a war against isis or the barbarians raiding rome i want to die for something i feel like i am falling off the deep end i do not think i cannot take anymore of this nothing i do is useful i have tried therapy medication and try to go on normally i end up in the same old place every timei feel terrible about myself i just want to drop out of college and give up on my dreams i am not as great as the others so what is the point in proceeding sure i make good grades but i do not have any great skill or talents everyone around me is so much better than i am and there is me unlike everyone else who is worth something i am about as valuable as a speck of dust just there to be thrown away i might as well give up on my dreams it probably was not important anywaysi just want to give up i want to give up on everything i do not know how much more i can take it so i posted to a group where me and my friends chat about how if i was gone for a long period without talking 2 weeks since i am quite active there that i was probably dead the reason being my parents want us to move to the country side with no internet beacause they are conspiracy theorists and such and the internet is basically my only support and i honestly could not talk to them about my problems and they no way would not move to the country side even if i pleaded on my knees and i honestly do not think i would want to live anymore at that pointi have anger issues and when i get quite angry i have the urge to take a knife and stab myself in the throat and i am quite open about this to my family of course they take it as a joke a little goof a gag a punchline so they never take it seriously to be honest if we did move i would probably stab myself to death or at least drown myself i could not stand moving so far away from my dreams ambitions and friends like that and at that point i do not see a reason to live my life is already screwed up so i do not see a reason to stay at that point so back to my friends i told them straight up if i am gone for 2 weeks no talking that i probably killed myself i wanted them to know this since i did not like the idea of them never knowing what happened to me since i know if i was in they are position that i would want to know why someone so active just stopped posting and i left for bed i came back tomorrow and only one of them said anything out of the 4 friends 1 of them ignored me maybe did not see the message but be were never all that close and the other 2 had not posted so i assume they were offline the one that responded did not know how to react and when i checked recently they were panicking asking if anyone saw me online and that they were worried about me and i do not know how to respond staying silent would be a dick move i do not want to make them upset yknow but at the same time i do not know what to say i cannot promise that i will not kill myself it is the truth i would buy do not like seeing the upset but i do not want them to live on thinking i am okay i am honestly confused i am only 13 and i honestly cannot think of what to say to them any ideas i need some advice i feel like i ruined everyone is lives and now no one likes me i feel like a failure i feel like a lost because i feel like a burden i feel like jumping off a building i feel like everyone has given up on me and i feel as if everyone will be better off without me rant i guess i have made the decision that i am not going to be sucked into the capitalistic hierarchical classist corpratociratic machine that entraps the world by whatever means necessary there is little joy to be gained from life and anyone with half a braincell can tell you it its only going to get worse from here and that any sort of major societal revolution is never going to come and any hopes of a world where humanity is free from itself have been dead for generations footnote i just realized i sound so much like a marxist lol i have made a decision i am tired of it i am seriously done i feel like nobody in my life actually cares about me as much as i try to think about it i am selfish i am conceited whenever i make conversation i slip up all the time i do not click with anybody i make it awkward i get looks not just from strangers but from my family i feel like i cannot even tell my feelings to my boyfriend anymore i am selfish for that nobody includes me in things i am a nuisance ever since i moved homes i am in the living room on the couch i am a living burden i am genuinely convinced that if i put a bullet through my brain my family would throw a party i am literally useless and my only redeeming quality is draws good and where will that get me suicide i fucking hate myself and i am seriously considering it seriously i am convinced thoroughly that i am just a nuisance a burden a waste of space and air and oxygen and that i am just nothing in the world i hope my family drives me instead of continuing to fake loving me i hope they get mad at me enough just tell me you want me dead tell me you hate everything about me what is even the point anymore i am 31 and live in a very abusive home where my family tells mr how worthless i am everydayi got verbally abused every day of my life and i am trying to sort my paper work out and get a good job and move outi cannot get a job right nowbut when i can i am getting to jobs and getting the hell outthere one of the biggest reasons i am miserable and it is here or i go homeless since nobody in my family wants to help me or cares about meso it is stay here until i save up or go homeless and never find another jobbut i am going to hurt myself if i keep staying here i want out i want help i am tired of suffering everyday i want this to end i need helpplease someone help me i do not know what to do about my life i take care of my whole family i do everything despite being diagnosed with an incurable illnessno one fucking cares and the whole stay no do not kill yourself because people around you will miss you and be heartbroken yeah i am fucking sure they would then they would not have anyone to be the goddamn adult despite being the youngest they would not have anyone to take care of them that is what they would miss and maybe they should i have told them countless times how i feel they do not care maybe they deserve to be heartbroken i do not deserve to suffer so why should i stay fuck this see you next time i am not enough to observe before i start i promise i will show this and my other suicide notes to my therapist whenever i see them i have been suffering from mental health illnesses for years was diagnosed 6 years ago i hate it i genuinely hate it i have to take meds to boost serotonin levels storebought serotonin as i call them on my birthday in june i told myself i will end things an year from then provided things do not get better i am 24 and am yet to do achieve anything significant unlike my parents siblings close friends and connections on linkedin turning 24 recently is really hitting me hard i graduated university at 21 and have done internships a local bank a big 4 firm consulting firm and startups every now and then my last paid internship ended before the summer of 2020 i am yet to secure a fulltime paid job since unlike my peers who are pretty successful in the corporate world ie they are getting promoted or moving to international offices say london uk but then there is me i have wasted the last 3 years of my life i could have learnt a new language i could have learnt new software say powerbi i could have been studying towards a professional qualification say cfa capm etc i could have lost weight and gained muscle my ex left me at 21 because of me being suicidal and unstable back then but my untreated mental illnesses do not let me too i messed up the final two years at university relative to my first year performance which was stellar at all of my internships i was extremely slow with tasks ie making ppt slides replying to emails i believe i have undiagnosed psychomotor retardation in my daily life i avoid doing a lot of chores for instance doing the dishes folding my laundry cooking reading a book it takes me 30ish minutes to do the dishes something that would take my sibling 15 minutes it takes me 7 minutes to read a page of a novel taking that into account it would take me 2 months to finish a 300 page novel because of how slow i am i have gotten very dumb too i struggle with basic mental maths and avoid doing things that require a lot of brain power i am not even sure if therapy would help me i am scared of entering the corporate world or pursuing a masters because of how slow and dumb i am and how stressed i get in pressured situations i point fingers towards my untreated mental illnesses at times i wish i had cancer or something similar to show people around me that i was actually struggling even though i told myself i will commit suicide a day after my birthday next year in june if things do not get better ie i do not land a fulltime job and not be as slow as i am today however i feel like ending things this saturday my method of suicide would be jumping off a bridge near a major public hospital and getting hit by an incoming vehicle once i jump or i will overdose on my meds but very likely that will be next june whenever i hear of people dying on the news or from other sources i say lucky them i wish it was me instead of them i always pray i die in my sleep but here i fucking am i know things will not get better there is too many things to work on and fix i am better off dying either naturally or via suicide i am currently working on launching a nonprofit startup centered around mental health in that case it will further motivate everyone involved in case i end up killing myself turning 24 has really hit me it feels like i have run out of time to achieve thingsit is too hard to turn things around if you have made it this far i appreciate you reading of my struggles and my suicidal thoughts i have had enough in tears as i type this every time i go through a cycle of happiness and depression it just keeps getting worse i cannot keep going on like this for the rest of my life i just want to be better but my mind says no i do not know how to help myself anymore this is the first time i have considered suicide in my life because i am so scared about going through these emotions again and again until i die my head hurts so much from crying i want it to stop does the cycle ever stop tell me i am wrong but you cannot you know its true either you let the pandemic kill you or you be proactive and beat the pandemic to it i wish the cdc and who would be intellectually honest and just admit there is no way life is worth living anymore and that they just recommend suicide already every day i stay alive i am supplied more and more proof the only escape from this pandemic is suicide i think i am useless and i tried to kill myself on a concoction took 22 1mg xanax as well as 150mg tramadol 25mg diphenhydramine 150mg seroquel and lucky my older brother found me slumped and unresponsive where he called 911 and told them i was breathing strangely then i was taken to the hospital where they found a whole lotta drugs i had taken and for some reason the er doctor told my brother that that the marijuana they found in my system was very serious really this mans never touched weed before i assume anyway they found benzos because i took my whole script of xanax and have no recollection of it this was after i blacked out after taking benedryl and then i woke up the next morning with bandages from an iv and my parents were not happy though i do not live with them i woke up in my childhood bedrooom please do not mess with benzos they are extremely dangerous when my brother found me unconscious i was chocking on my own spit he turned me onto my side but i am grateful for what he did and now i realize how precious life is i was always depressed and found no point in life but this all changed and i hope somebody found this helpful i was near death and thank god my brother had a weird feeling to come check on me most likely saved my life overdosed today and suddenly had weird glimpses of my mother and my girlfriend crying and missing me i feel like i am losing my best friend she does not seem the same around me anymore and avoids affection which usually she is very affectionate so that rlly worries me lol idk hwat to do if i lose her i will have no future bc my future was supposed to b with her i want to kill myself help i left my job recently where i found out my boss was seducing his teenage employees a couple years ago i dropped out of college because i was having severe mental issues like depression delusions hearing shit in my head bad relationships had quite a few shitty jobs that treated me like shit abandonment issues from friendships and family relationships through the years idk it is all just coming forth in my mind all at oncei cannot get myself to see a therapist because i do not want to start another relationship with someone and try to dig into shit when i just want immediate solutions i do not see a future for myself everyone fucking hates me and gives nothing in return i ask for help nothing and now my career is fucking ruined from my last job i cannot even work in the same field which is what i have been doing all my working life otherwise i have meltdowns just thinking about itim even engaged but i just feel like such a fucking burdeni think i am just ready it is time to go there are much better people out in the world that are more capable than me i am just another one to stop the chain of depressed alcoholic addicts in the food chain good riddance i have never actually committed to the idea of actually following through until earlier this week i had group therapy for the first time today it sucked i quit immediately there are not any in person one on one therapists here not only that i do not even really know what to do to get better or if i want to get better in the first place my biggest problem that i am nonbinary is not even fixable outcast amongst outcasts it is got to be the most hated minority since even other trans people hate on us not to mention other lgbt people and obviously everyone else i read that like 87 of people would not even date a trans person so i am assuming the numbers even higher for nonbinary people which makes everything very isolating there is no way in the world i could even date in my current state but even if i could i would never find anyone nearby i thought the first step would be going to therapy but that is over i looked up the ones that take my insurance and there is like 4 in this area 0 of which offer in person and then even if we pretend everything else was solved i still have no way to support myself no way i can work because everything makes me want to kill myself no way to go back to school because i am poor no interests or passions at all besides making art there is not a single valid reason why i should not kill myself if i had a gun or heroin i would not think twice nothing left for me here literally nobody wants to be my friend i am going to overdose getting rejected so my birthday is coming up soon and just like every year i am dreading it it is one of the worst days of the year for me it is also one of the days that i think about dying the most not necessarily through suicide but by any means like freak accidents accidental overdose just anything that will end my life nothing ever happens but sometimes it makes me wonder what would happen if i did die how would it affect my loved oneshas anyone ever lost someone close on that persons birthday and how did the passing of this person affect you and the other people close to himher i am mainly looking for people who died by their own choice but if it was due to other causes you can still comment i like many others here want the pain to end but do not know if i can go through with it if it will hurt those around meplease only post if you feel comfortable ending it on a birthday i am supposed to be going on vacation tomorrow around 45am but i do not see a point in going maybe i can beg my grandma to let me stay home and i can do the deed when no ones home i know my grandma says she cares but she verballyemotionallymentally abuses me it is either i kill myself or i wait for my physicallyverbally abusive brother to lash out one day and do it for me i have pills here and i am considering ending it i just do not want to leave the puppies alone i cannot even be myself i am non binary and my whole family it seems is against all non binary people maybe i can wait another 2 months wait for school to start and see if i will give life another chance i am sorry for the rant i do not know what the point of this was no one loves me how can i love myself not encouraging suicide or publicly disclosing the method but just saying i personally am all set to go i will probably live a week or two more goodbye cruel cruel world found a good painless method started therapy two weeks ago it literally feels like talking at a wall i have never felt less heard i do not know what to do anymore there is no light at the end of the tunnel what the fuck am i living for nothing helps around the first of july i unintentionally overdosed on fent pills now all i can think about is the relief i can have from not being alive everyday i wake up wishing the perc would take me i have been clean for a while but man a couple drinks and a perc so i could finally end this consistent suffering that is my mental health overdosed of the percs no one would care everyone probably already wants me gone i am just worthless life is pointless anyway i am not going anywhere i already do nothing for everyone and that probably will not change as far as i know i am more of a burden than i think i am everyone would probably say they care but it never feels like they do it just feels like they say it so that they do not feel bad but they do not think about me and here i am complaining about it on a site where probably no one else cares about me just wasting time and doing nothing to solve my problems honestly just waiting for someone to tell me to kill myself or maybe i will just do it anyway death happens anyway might as well spare everyone the trouble and get rid of myself before i make everyone else more miserable should i just kill myself i am a 17 yo guy and i have been struggling with depression derealization and paranoia ever since i was 12 on top of that i now have gadi have been wanting to kill myself since i was 12 because at 12 yo i started having episodes of derealization caused by the paranoia that everything is a dream or fakei have somewhat gotten over that but all that has been replaced by depression and anxiety which caused me to fail 2 years of school i hate myself for letting that happenwhen school is on every day i think of suicide and have really bad suicidal depressive mental breakdowns every nightright now it is summer break but i cannot take all that pressure again sadly dropping out is not an option for mei also hate myself because of my height i am only 58172cm tall and i live in a country where the male average height is 511182cm that makes me feel really inferior weak and pathetic because most guys i know are taller than mei think i feel bad about my height because i am secretly competitive so i have been feeling my whole life like growing taller is a competitionjust for the record i am already in therapy and on antipsychotics and antidepressants also been in a psych ward 7 times all that has not helpednothing helps i think i am going to kill myself on the 31st of august i think i am going to kill myself i have squandered most of my opportunities in life and i feel like a loser because i am i was a high school athlete and i was a very social person growing up now just turning 30 i have dropped out of collegeuniversity twice and only have a diploma in music production which makes me extremely overwhelmed and anxious anytime i even attempt to make anything i was in human resources last year and missed one course on my final semester so i never graduated i hated the curriculum anyways bunch of cucklord social justice bs i am kind of at the end of my ropes now though i am 30 years old and feel like a huge loser i moved back in with my parents who are constantly trying to get me to move out again and telling me to go take school or another program that i have no idea if i should take or not life is slowly falling apart around me my parents are getting older and life feels like it is getting worse every day i am in canada and cannot even buy a gun to die part of me does not want to die because i do not want to fuck up everyone elses lives around me but nothing seems to help me get better i am starting to lose faith in myself and my ability to move forward the only friends who i occasionally talk to drink alcohol all day and smoke weedplay video games they are complete losers i used to do shit like this but i do not want to do this shit anymore i feel like i have no idea how to get better i am tired and exhausted and things just are not enjoyable medication also does not seem to work for me i get bad anxiety on antidepressants and yea i also used to experiment with a lot of mdma and smoke a ton of pot over 5 10 years ago when i was first in university and i think that might have fucked me up as well life just sucks man i legit have no clue wtf to do anymore i am 30 and probably should be taking a job working at starbucks fuck i wish i had some support and any advice for someone on how i can turn my life around fuck i have also tried stopping watching porn and doing that and i think that definitely helps i really hope life gets better for me i have a hard time even trusting any people anymore because i have had some fucked up experiences with other crazy people who used me and took advantage of me i am not sure i can recover i feel like i have squandered all my opportunities in life and i am ready to die just turned 30 and life seems pretty pointless for me now going to delete testing it i am still allowed on this sub testing testing yeah yeah i have been extremely sad and disappointed in life for months and its never been this bad when i was a freshman i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and even then it has never been as this bad never i have never struggled this much nothing even triggered it i just do not understand it i am deeply sad and so unsatisfied with life rn i have been thinking of suicide for a while but i have stayed alive bc i keep thinking and hoping it will get better i have never struggled this much but oh my god it is not getting better please tell me you understand my abusive bf makes me wish my suicide attempt a year ago worked he is the most disgustingly cruel person to me ever since i caught him sneaking around behind my back he is not at all the person i began this relationship with i want out and every time i try to leave i cannot and it makes me go back to the feeling a year ago when i saw killing myself as the only way out of this constant abuse i want out i am starting spravato nasal spray esketamine on monday i have heard there is some pretty great results but i have also had over 50 courses of ect as a teenager i mean hell i am only 19 now and that did not have much benefit in fact the only lasting effect was intense memory issues i cannot remember my childhood at all i am so miserable every single day the normal treatments just do not work for me i have got social anxiety and do not have a true friend the only person there for me is me if this treatment does not work i am going to kill myself and i need to mentally prepare for that i am not going to make it to 20 my suicide is inevitable i am scared of death but it is inevitable so therefore i do not think suicide would be a bad idea i am just scared if this treatment does not work i am going to kill myself its definitely an over reaction but its my only solution to any of my problems i could literally make the smallest mistake and my only thoughts afterward are that i should just kill myself i really want to just end it i am always surprised at how well people ignore all this but fuck i am tired thanks for reading just venting postpartum depression has got me by the throat the medicine therapy support group etc have all failed i think i might do it tonight i am so frustrated all the time i just cannot do anything i feel incapable of the most basic of tasks and also of my dreams i am so sick of it i feel an urge to die all the time literally always and it feels inevitable to me that i will give in eventually i am so scared of death but life feels bad to me most of the time an interesting title i am slowly realizing that life just was not made for me suicide seems inevitable i do not want to die peacefully though i need my death to be exciting and an adrenaline rush maybe something like jumping out a plane with bombs attached to me or maybe a heist gone wrong it sounds like a better experience than slitting my wrists anybody else want to go out with a bang every day i constantly am searching for things to distract myself anything from the constant feeling of guilt for not killing myself i feel like a constant burden and disappointment to everyone i know and i am losing my mind i have to hide that i am nonbinary and suicidal to everyone in my life and its fucking killing me inside my boyfriend tries to help but i cannot tell him what i am thinking because he might blame himself or try to help me on his own and i do not want to put that burden on him i just want to die i am tired of the constant guilt and the thought of jumping out of every moving car i am in or jumping from the nearest windows to me every fucking day i cannot do this 358 days ago i made my last post and here i am again if i had known i was going to wind up back in this place i would have just killed myself back then it gets better is a lie it does not get better nobody gives a fuck i am sitting here with a bottle of whiskey and all the pills in my house i am alone i am afraid i hope it does not hurt i hope it works i hope there is no hell that is any worse than this life fucking adios if i would have known it was going to end this way i would have killed myself a year ago what makes it worse is she is white and i am mixed black  white like think about how i fucking feel about my mom freely using the n word out loud yes the entire word with er on the end ugh i just cannot take it anymore every time she has said that i just get a stabbing pain in my chest like how can she do that with mixed kids who are half black my mom just says the n word to insult someone i just need to get this out i just lost my job of three years i have been depressed for a long time and i just want to die it is to much every day it is a new pain every waking hours i am searching for a new distraction it is just getting to hard to keep going life is getting to hard i have never attempted suicide but over the last few months my life has become so overwhelming that its now a constant thought my grandfather committed suicide when my mom was 10 years old which affected me in two ways 1 i actually understand how painful it is for the people you leave behind that is why i said i have never attempted it even though i have thought about it many many times and 2 everyone in my family believes its hereditary and gets overly concerned when i am in a mood it makes it impossible to talk to anyone close to me about my own thoughts of suicide because i feel like they will take it almost too seriously i know that does not make sense but i actually hate when people feel sorry for me so i bottle up my depression and lash out at the people i love in a perverse way i almost wish they all hated me so that it would make it easier to leave them the logical part of my brain says my life will turn around and the depression will subside  that is just how life is its just incredibly painful right now before anyone suggests i go see a therapist or get on medication i have seriously thought about it but unfortunately my depression is currently stemming from the fact that my business failed i am in a black hole of debt and i cannot afford health insurance money troubles  it does not get more cliche than that i do not care if anyone reads this or responds i just found it incredibly therapeutic to finally vent all of this this subreddit helped just to see that my situation is not unique and were all humans dealing with our own circumstances there is probably someone in our life that is going through their own version of hell and well never know about it and there is definitely at least one person in our lives that deeply cares about us whether we recognize it or not to all the people battling with depression recognize it for what it is and do not give up the fight and to all the supportive members here i want you to know that you are making a difference venting i am terrified to die but i do not want to be here anymore my little brother is the only thing holding me back i have always said i would not leave him until he got old enough he is now 15 and i am 22 and as the years go by it gets harder to actually wait i am so tired and i am so empty and feel useless all the time i do not know how much longer i can hold on i do not remember what it feels like to be happy i am in a psych ward but being released in a few days and then it will not be long until i can get my things in order to end things i am so over this life feel so alone and counting down the days until i can do it i have experienced a lot of life a lot of bad life especially drugs mental illness broken family life years of therapy i even found the love of my life but i know i cannot make him happy he is miserable and i bring him down everyday he deserves better and i cannot give him better my mom also died of covid 19 recently i downloaded this as a last stitch effort to connect with anyone in the entire world who can help me or just talk to me without bias i saw this while looking up ways to kill myself and thought fuck it why not what could the rush be why not see if a single person has anything to say to me to change my mind going to kill myself soon there are noises all around her but the silence is louder from the ground she watchesthe kids ready to take flight on the swings the dogs leaping into the air the birds circling the tops of the trees she is searching for something her eyes dart back and forth unable to rest until they find whatever it is she is looking for people come and go until she is the only one left its getting cold the silence is deafening as she approaches the playground there is a ladder but she will not use itthat would be too easy instead she scales the outer walls and pulls herself up and onto the slanted roof of the structure until she is at its highest point on top of the world and surrounded by fences she stands closing her eyes so they do not have to and let us the silence consume her freak accident oc talking about things does not seem to help it only seems to worsens things i do not have much motivation to talk or ask for help because they will always say the same things i think about this every day i am just waiting until i can find the opportunities it seemsi cannot even imagine what could possibly help i really do not want any help i do not want anyone elses idea of happiness if anything i want to express this so i am posting this pointless idk why but in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me i have been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since i do not want to end up in the psych ward again i honestly do not know what to do at this rate the thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately count down to the end no longer coping god i just want to slit my wrists already i want to cut my arms so much to the point where blood covers it all i want to destroy my face my legs my chest my stomach everything everyday just gets worse no matter how hard i try my meds do not work coping mechanisms do not work therapy dosent work nothing works people tell me to stay strong and to fight but they do not understand that i already lost a long time ago i do not want to be here anymore five days ago i decided that i am going to do it today i had it all planned out and wrote a note and alli promised my best friend that i will go to a roadtrip with him then i wanted to have some time to cuddle with my girlfriend and then go to work and do it i work as a night receptionist so i thought it would give me enough time and space to clear my mind and get myself to do itand i keep climbing to the roof and i cannot do it i keep trying saying no and going back to reception in order to cry uncontrollably for 5 mins and then just continue working for another 35 if i found some new meaning in life i would be happy but everything seems as fucking desperate as it was i do not feel like i am any better than i was i do not deserve nor want to be here any more than 5 days ago when i planned it outso at this point i am just venting because i do not know what is happening i want to jump but i cannot make myself do it i feel stuck in this limbo or whatever it is i thought i was going to do it today i am currently in a living situation that is far from ideal and becoming unbearable i need to move out but i feel immense guilt and concern because of how much i am needed here ill start by explaining my relationship with my family older brother x my mom and i immigrated from cuba when i was 4 years old i am now 21 we had to leave x behind we are 11 years apart and he did not come to the us until i was 16 because of the cost of communication and our extreme poverty throughout those years x and i did not get to know each other at all when he came he felt like a stranger that i was expected to love because of our blood relation from the ages of 1621 he has engaged with my body in sexual manners without my consent grabbing my ass slapping my ass getting on top of me removing my clothing forcefully entering the bathroom when i am showering and looking at me naked etc no one is aware of this except my therapist i should mention that he is an alcoholic and some of these instances occurred when he was under the influence about 2 years ago he moved out with his girlfriend but they recently broke up so he moved back home i am now living with him again younger brother y y and i are also strangely enough 11 years apart but on the other end he is such an impeccable human he is my best friend watching him grow up has been the most fulfilling experience of my life unfortunately the responsibility is too much his dad passed away when he was young so it was only him my mom and i until 2016 when x moved to the us and joined us my mom had to work a lot and i was relied on to take care of my y this had an extreme effect on my education extracurricular social life and mental health i did not sign up to become a parent apart from financial support y relies on me for everything my mom relies on me for everything mom this is of course the most complex relationship i have however i will not go into as much detail she treats me like a child does not allow me to see friends constantly making homophobic remarks does not know i am gay constantly offending my expression or lack thereof does not support any of my decisions forces me to shave armpits and legs because it is gross and is unladylike cannot talk to her because everything turns into an argument the list truly never ends  but she needs me to take care of y translate every document upkeep the house etc i understand her pain and suffering she has been through so much and i know she truly does need me this is why i am still here i am needed i am afraid of what will happen to them without me but i am tired of being used disrespected neglected uncomfortable abused i am so exhausted i need to focus on my life i need to prioritize myself but i cannot i am stuck we are all currently living in a small 2 bedroom house my mom is sleeping in the living room while y and i share a room and x has his own i am in college but because of the pandemic i am staying here i probably will be taking the upcoming semester off because its too difficult to do school here a few weeks ago i was suicidal and i almost did it but i realized that the reason i wanted to kill myself was also the reason that i could not i am in therapy for severe depression and learning how to socialize i also experience derealization often i do not know what i want to receive i just needed to release thank you for listening i was suicidal and i almost did it but i realized that the reason i wanted to kill myself was also the reason that i could not some days i want to just end it all because it feels like nobody would actually care all my friends just dropped me my boyfriend does not understand my trama and bland me when i have a breakdown and i just want to die i do not feel anything but the urge to kill myself rn some days a fork in the outlet a rope throat slit pills or a laylon bag what is faster been waking up everyday with really no hope i have been told also that i have syphilis i do not really want treatment and hope it just kills me nobody really wants me around they just try to make me feel better by pretending to care i live in a shitty neighborhood where i am constantly living in fear with a bipolar dad that dishes out his criticism and disappointment on me i am worn out like before i was working out and working but it hit me what am i doing this for if i have nothing to really cherish anyway i am always thinking about others but i am always getting the back end of shit i am fucking exhausted i am tired of not being able to hold a job because i cannot get along with anyone i am tired of being ignored in situations where i am trying to excel i am tired of being disrespected i am tired of feeling so anxious to even be apart of society i am tired of thinking there is a future for me when in realty i am so fucked i am better off dead i get shitted on everyday for who i am how am i suppose to be happy at all i am tired of searching through these fucking hook up apps just to find some damn friends i am fucking tired had my 26th birthday on the 26th and did not really celebrate life is so dull now its real pain i do not deserve to be alive tried of consciousness  i do not want it just want it all to stop i do not deserve this pain i grew up with abuse i do not deserve this suffering i do not accept this suffering i do not want to fckng cope with this suffering anymore i have had enough i am going mental by hiding this pain inside of me i have to fcking express myself i cannot simply cope i do not accept it cuz i accepted it for so fcking long and it ruined my mental health there is nothing wrong with me there is everything wrong with the abuse and hate i am receiving from my own family member i did not choose to see my mom getting abused and beaten when i was a kid i did not choose the same thing for myself i did not choose to be brainwashed and manipulated i did not choose it i do not accept it  i rather die with peace than to suffer thinking to kill myself today i have been feeling very ill for a long time i pacified my emptiness with opiates i am not clean and feel worse than ever i am 100 sure i will die by my own hand this darkness inside is overwhelming i am not sure how much longer i can hold on i feel i am slipping away i am probably going to kill myself maybe after this post maybe after i eat dinner i hate this world i hate my myself i hate my looks my brain and my life the world will be broken beyond repair when i become an adult i have no love interest my family probably hates me no matter how much they say otherwise and id be terrible at any job id getso i am done see you all you can convince me not to if you would like but i just want to talk to someone before i die not promising ill die though i have failed before as you can see from my posts here this world can kiss my ass  would my mom get a refund for school registration if i died i have been depressed for long time and whenever i seem to get a boost in happiness i get reminded of the current world the rich are getting richer by exploitation the rich are going to space while people are eating out of garbage cans and sleeping on benchesi am most terrified of climate change we are not doing anything about it and the blame is always put on us rather than companiesi do not know how anyone is happy in this world but the rich i am terrified of the future as the title says i have been going bald for the past few years and it is made my life a living hell without a shred of hope it is started when i was around 16517 24 now and basically my life had stopped ever since i need to mention i am using the common medications for hair loss and though i have had nice results for some time my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worsei am so lonley have no social life since i am ashamed to go outside have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman and it is all because of this malicious curse i would trade absolutely everything i have to have a normal head of hair like a guy my age should have i would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance i know the hair is not my only problem but it is most definitely the core of all the other onesi was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as i am still trying to fight for my life hopeful to make an appointment and although the guy there said it is still too early for me does not mean it looks anywhere near decent he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when i had last visited the clinic and i looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what i have now in fact i was once a pretty handsome guy though never appreciated it but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old sad and ugly to a point of no returnin that point of time it really does not matter whether i actually end my life or not because i feel like i am already dead actually i do not even feel like i am human anymore just a pathetic useless piece of rubbish having better days is actually the worst thing because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse my youth has been taken away from me and i feel doomed to be lonley and hating my appearance for the rest of my lifei have no idea what is the point of this post but anyway thank you for reading and have a nice rest of the week going bald is slowly killing me no matter what i do in everything i fail extensive training hard work full on focus getting tutoredcoached i then still fucking fail no matter what every single time i am a fucking dumbass and there is nothing i can do about being a dumbass there is no iq booster its the brain i am born with fuck this piece of shit life that i have i can never succeed in anything i put my mind to whatsoever there is no hope for that none i cannot wait to end it what is the point if you work your ass off and still fail everytime i went and tried to get help for my suicidal thoughts at a and e and after waiting crying in a chair for 6 hours and me telling them i wanted to try hang myself again they told me to go home and resti am so confused why will not anyone help me i am trying so hardthey say go get help do not give in  but when i go for help i am turned away i feel like i am just going to break hopeless hi i do not know why i am writing this here or anywhere at all but i feel like a mess and do not know what to do and pheraps someone here can help mei cannot say i have ever struggled in life i had everything i needed to this day my parents always suported me even when i probablt disnt deserve it i have a social life and friends even tho i am not very social i feel like i have every thing one would need to live right however i do not feel good about myself have not felt since around 7 grade even tho i had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future i never tried my best in school even tho i was fully aware that i needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me i ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows i saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something and there i was left behind with no purpose whatsoever i started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself purpose value right and wrong it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion things i had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what i now know as nihilism i started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless talking to people seemed meaningless to me i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so i would not have to think about living and life in general the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color and that when it hit me why do i have to live like this all this thoughts lonelyness zero purpose crying nights what reason do i have to stay suicide made its home in my head from there on but i still feared deaths there were a few times where i grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking can i do this what if this what if that i never could bring myself to do it and i always ended up cryng over how i cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle after sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity i felt i was the relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption everytime she went out to party i was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night with time and her icentive i went to college as well my parents had to getmoney from the bank to pay for it but i felt like i was getting out of my hole fjnnaly a light at the end of the tunnel but it was not like that today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life even tho my parents made the biggest effort i still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose and now i feel slowly faling back into that hole i even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to live and still lack pupose i try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism lately i have been feeling like a lost case i suicide has been on my mind lately as well i just do not know what to do i still fear death and the worst part is that i had everything and i messed up i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward i feel miserable a failiure and a waste of effort that was put on me i am sorry for the long text and the bad english but i dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what i felt for at least on time in my life thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going oportunities will arise but please take them make it worth it do not be like me i do not know what to do nothhhingggggggg but pain of course i get nothing out of life everything seems to be orchestrated to make me feel the absolute worse surprised i have not had a heart attack yet prob will soon my stress levels r never low my life is so against me i have had anxiety and depression for as long as i can remember and from last year it is been really bad now this year is just pushing me over the edge first my grandpa died then my dad got so sick he could have died and needed an emergency operation and he will need one more in a few months then my cat got really sick and she is still sick and i am trying so hard to get her better but i am failing then an animal at work that i have been really close to died while under my care i have a partner but no friends and animals are my heart and soul people generally repulse me so people might think that pet problems would not effect someone very much but for me it totally stops my life and takes me overthe anxiety about my dad being ok is just on my mind constantly and the fact that the animal at work died under my care makes me feel so horrible and useless i could not save him what the he will am i even there for then and then my loving lovely cat that i cannot help what the hell am i here for then i wish she could just get better and i could get sick instead i would give my life for her wellbeing if it was only possible to make the trade i have not slept in 4 nights because i have been watching over her and now awaits another sleepless night and then tomorrow i have to go to work and it is killing me because ill have to leave my cat and i will not be able to watch her and i will just be a ball of anxiety while somehow workingmy partner tries to be supportive but she does not really understand and when she jokes and smiles i just feel so alonethe only thing that keeps me from killing myself is how much it would hurt my parents and that i would fail my cat she would not understand where her mommy went and then she would have to move and get a new mommy and i am responsible for her but i am starting to feel like i am failing her anyways and someone else could be a better mommy to her and my parents are probably so tired of me and my constant nagging from worryingeverytime i am driving i am thinking about finding a good brick wall to accelerate in to i cannot take this any more the constant sadness hopelessness worrying and fear this year has been hell and i just want to leave just forced to carry on with this stagnant awful lifeless existence i just want to scream cannot even do that if i am going to live like some ai bot then at least give me the emotionless state of one too tired of the pain i am about to wake up tomorrow and have to act as if i was not just crying my eyes out last nightid love to b able to hire a hitman fr no way out so i am in my 30s cptsd pretty much every single symptom of thatchildhood neglect childhood abuse be molested as a kid and they grew up to be raped and physically abused and drugged i have been beat up by a boyfriend all that crapso here i am i told my mom last week that i am not going to make it to the end of the year i am not getting the proper help i can only see counsellor once a week and her advice for that was to find a psychologist that she would pay for once a month last time i was in the hospital they said my cptsd is critical and i need like the life saving helpso last week told my mom i need something more something impatient something where i can actually heal if you forgive me the right treatment her advice was basically stopped being a little bitch and just go back to the 24hour holdthen i called her 30 days ago and said i cannot fucking do this i am going to kill myself and i do not want to but i need like intense intervention right now or i am going to lose my fighther response was i do not know what to do but should i call the police on younow 2 days after which is now today she calls me and leaves a voicemail cuz i was on the phone with two other lines already like one was i was on hold and the other one was actively like having a conversation she send s this sulky guilt trippy fake i care about you i really need to know how you are doing so i actually tried to call back because there is not maybe she wanted to finally help me 6 hours later she finally picks up and says you know i have friends and people and places to be you do not need to be calling me all the time and i said yeah like always there is always something before me and then i told her i figured out the trip that she takes quite often is hours shorter than a drive to me so why have not you showed upshe says i do not have an answer i cannot talk to you right now you are always being an hassle and hung upso in case i was not feeling it desperate as soon as i am before i just i got you kitten thinking it could be something to look for but i am dying i cannot feel it i have not done anything that i just you know when your time is coming and i am trying my best to hold on but everybody pries my fingers off i just need to figure out who i give trust with my cat because she deserves the best and then my times up times almost up i come home from school lock myself in my room cut myself up and write suicide notes then when i finally manage to come out for dinner they get angry at me for not doing my chores and say i am lazy and i am just addicted to my pc then i have a full on mental breakdown in front of them and that just say its because i am not on my pc because of how addicted i am its not fair tf am i even supposed to do now its not fair how little my parents understand me i do not do anything things just happen to me i am powerless i cannot survive on my own i cannot leave my house i do not feed myself i can barely work for a few hours sitting at a computer before getting exhausted exhaustion that makes the chest feel heavy and the eyes drop and i just feel like screaming i cannot bear the responsibility of being alive i just exist i wake up i look for reasons to get up cannot find any so i just do because i am expected to not because i really want itits all so taxing so tiring and to be honest i do not want to get better i just want to rest i do not understand where do people draw the strenght to keep waking up everyday voluntarily then again i have nothing to cling on no friends no future no goals or ambitions and there is always the temptation and the choice to just quit i am past the point of wanting friends i am scared of friendships i have not have one since middle schooli m not going to get vaccinated tptb do not care about me so why so suddenly do they want me to get a shot its in my best interest you say no dying is my best interest i already had covid back in february i was a coward i will not kill myself death will come to me like everything in life complaining will not solve anything but i do not care i never accomplish anything either i am not fully commited to living and never will be if i do not get back into my college courses for next year then ill do it at the end of august same for if i am not 9095lbs by the end of augustif i get into college next year ill give it 12 months to see how its going if i spend all my breaks in the bathroom or i do not make any friends then ill kill myself after halloweenif for some reason i am not super lonely again ill see how my grades are by christmas if i am failing anything ill do it after christmas so i get at least one last christmas with my familyif i do not have a job by my brothers birthday ill kill myself in januaryand if life is still going shit by my birthday next year ill kill myself just beforeafter my 18thi think that is a pretty decent plan of the next potential year of my life i will kill myself eventually this is my plan for the next year the only things my mom can do is provide with the bare minimum which are food shelter and etc other than that she is just terrible and maybe sometimes she is nice when she is not screaming at me for nothing i would say she is toxic because she always compares me to others including herself she is a massive hypocrite who gets mad at me when i do the exact same thing as her shr hit me as a child and also once when i was 12 byt that is a different story she cursed at me as a child she even fighted with her own mom and also with her dad for like half a year after we moved with him and even though she knows i have trouble with selfharm and that i am suicidal because the psychiatrist had to tell her she did not change a bit still yelling at me for little things and because of one of our daily fights i relapsed after i tried so hard to resist the urges and i am writing this post right after one of our big fights where i again told her that she is not a good mom and that she is not self aware at all in the end i told her that i did not want the psychiatrist to tell her because i do not trust her i did not want to tell her that i think i have ocd because i do not trust her i told her about my almost suicide attempt and that it was right after one of our massive fights and after all that she says that there is still more life to live so i am just done i want to cut so bad right now but i do not want to use a

fucking is ill never get those goddamn years back i am useless why i am a fucking leech all good people did something trained young yet i am here with no fucking anything fuck this what is the point there no point to my existence i am 17 years old and i have done nothing with my life and a 13 year old won a gold metal at the olympics i feel like i am not amounting to anything i am useless i have done nothing to make my parents proud i am useless i am going to be 30 in a few months and i have struggled with suicidal thoughts since i was about 13 no matter what i do whether it be work out eat healthy take my meds do my job have relationships etc i always end up back in the same place my bf and i have been going through a rough patch and i am pretty sure he wants me to leave him alone so he can move on i told him i am having suicidal thoughts not as a way of manipulating him just trying to communicate what i am going through and he made me feel so terrible i am already ashamed for feeling this way and he said he does not know what i want him to do with this information i feel so alone and lost what is the point in life anymore i feel so ashamed i am from the uk and all my life there is just been pain from a young age i was sexually assaulted raped by my dad for years even though its years later i still cannot get over the traumatic memories tonight i was going to end it until my friend told my sister the world is pointless in one hundred years nobody will remember you anyway i am going to end it at 14 we broke up she was my first and will be my last never went into relationship before because i knew how much i would fall for the person i know compromises in a relationship should be for all the good causes of our personal wellbeings i do not think i am any good but i always encouraged her to be better than me personally academically and pure from the influence of drugs booze and people with negative energy and maintain a better social media hygiene etc despite all the hurtful things i have endured all i wanted in return were to influence me in a positive way for me to give up smoking control myself when got cranky at times etc so that it becomes a two way street she meant the world to me the world where great things would happen we made so many memories and planned our future together but in the end i lost her lost my world and i have nothing left no reason for me to stay in the world anymore they knew about my depression and they made fun of it and choose to hurt me they even made fun of the fact that i did not kill myself they hurt someone who was already broken inside and they are proud of iti do not want to be in pain anymore they won nobody cares i am lifeless i live only for the hope to be with the one who will understand me its impossible to describe the pain i have felt emotionally all i have had was myself to keep me from totally giving up telling myself to hang in there it will all get better i am strong i am lying to myself i see straight through everyone everyone i have known have all been fake i know they do not care about me i have cried myself to sleep multiple times this year i feel like i am the only one going through this even though i am not i try and i try to be the best person that i can be someone who can be accepted by others i want to die whenever i feel an ounce of happiness the pain always comes back to me i am tired of living after unsuccessful attempts i found my final plan for a week from now i found it ironic that that when a post asked to stop and thing about what i would miss and the only thing i could come up with was the state fair that i went to when i was young i am not asking for advice or planning to change my mind but i found it sad that was all i would miss id rather not share my story since i have shared it with so many in my life while i was asking for help and going to therapy this whole time and was always ignored or told that i just needed to continue to talk about it life was not fun hey reddit sorry if this is too much but i really do not know where else to turn to so any advice at all would be helpfulone of my closest friends since i was 15 has been going through a lot recently she is open about her feelings and what has happened to her and has always said she feels like her life is not worth living we had not talked for a while since 2018 but she reached out last month and we have been hanging out a lot since thenhowever she told me that at the beginning of this year she was sexually assaulted by an immediate family member and since then she has been traumatised and has developed ptsd she told the rest of her family about this when it happened and wanted to press charges against him but they do not hear that as the perpetrator is under the age of 16 and i think this is the main reason as to her feeling this way as she told me she had always been quite close with her mother who does not want her to press charges since then she has been living in a refuge as she cannot stand to be around her family understandably but it means that i cannot even try to call emergency services to come to her location as these places do not give out their address even to the residentsshe seems like she will go through with it as i found out she has been spending all of her money on her friends and buying people gifts which sounds like her because she is an amazing person who has always been there for other people and now it feels like no matter what i say or do it is not enough and as someone who has thought the same things as her i understand that completely she also told one of her friends that she has bought the equipment to commit suicide and is planning on doing it next week she did not specify which day as she does not want anyone stopping her as she had tried to get through to her mother again earlier today about pressing charges but to no availi have spent a lot of time with her recently as it felt really good seeing her again and catching up after so many years it is like she never left but she is about to she reconnected me with one of my old buddies too but since then told us that it was part of her bucket list i really do not know what to do i cannot even thin straight so i am trying to ask anyone i know for some advice the situation she is in is a horrible one which i cannot even fathom so it feels wrong even trying to look for some way to help her as she is so insistent on what she is planning to doif it helps with the advice we live in the uk any advice or help whatsoever would be so greatly appreciated my m21 friend f21 has been planning to kll herself next week and i do not know what to do i know it sounds stupid almost everyone outlives their grandparents but he is so important to me he has been involved in my life so much much more than my parents even hes like a parent and a best friend my homelife is very poor my mom is verbally abusive and my father works almost all of the time my grandparents house was the only place i could go to when no one else wanted me it is the only accepting place i know i love my grandfather more than anyone could imagine he is violently ill with covid we arent sure if he will make it he has been getting progeresivlet worse i have not seen him in two weeks i miss and and i want to make sure he is ok i am sorry pop i cannot live without you my grandfather is very ill and i do not know if i can live without him i am not a woman i am a man i am mentally a male but physically a female i have know this for years i just cannot live anymore every time i am referred to as a woman she as a her or someone is daughter it just feels like my mental health and stability just deteriorates more and more it makes me just want to jump off the edge at this point just seeing my disgusting body and face just wants to make me end it all i just feel so goddamning uncomfortable in my own skin in my own body i just wish i could finally live life as who i am as a man that i can finally be myself and stop wearing this mask around any and everyone id rather die than keep living as a woman i am being serious i feel so agonizingly hopeless that i feel like i have completely lost my mind i could go walk to the train tracks near my house and wait for a train but i am seriously afraid id survive the attempt and id be worse off than i am now the fact that i feel like i cannot end my life hurts more than what is making me want to end my life to begin with i do not know what to do anymore i feel so trapped the only think that is stopping me from ending my life is the fear of surviving the attempt so i have epilepsy and other various health conditions if i refuse my medication and tell my provider that would that be grounds for them to get me put in a psych unit against my will death by refusing medication i am a joke to everyone i am a dissapointment to my parents and my friend i hate living but i am to scared to kill myself i am a disgrace note this is a throwaway account specifically for this subreddit and a couple others of similar topicpretty much the only thing keeping me here is musicits like music knows when you need someone and it is genuinely the only friend that will not ever leave you behind when it eventually gets bored of you because it will not get bored of you music is just there forever whenever you need itwhoever invented music is a fucking geniushonestly i do not think i could have survived these 17 years without music it is been so painful at times and honestly i just feel like crying when i remember everything i have lived through especially the last 5 years but i had music and music got me through it allbecause of all of that shit any criticism i get from anyone hurts way more than it should but i do not show that of course because there is no point as nobody would understandbut that is not the point of this post i do not want to talk about that stuff here maybe one day i will make a post about that stuffmy point here is that music is the best most helpful most loving most comforting most amazing friend in the whole worldand i am scared that one day i will lose interest in music just like i lost interest in so many other things that i loved a few years ago i had some friends who i vented to a little but they did not understand me like music does and these friends all ditched me so i stopped venting to people unless i really really trust them even then they know barely anything about me yet here i am writing thisi do not even have to vent to music because music already knows and understands everything that you have been throughi am sorry if this makes no sense i am so tired while writing this so it probably does not make sensethank you for reading it means a lot to me music is the only true friend that will never leave you i cannot seem to do anything right i lack awareness on all levels i am bad at almost everything i do i am just slow in general i am 16 and it seems like i am surrounded by smart people even though the only reason it seems that way is because i am just such a moron i am so self conscious about my intelligence that i can barely focus on anything without constant thoughts about killing myself i am constantly reminded of my stupidity and i hate it i am trying to do activities like meditation yoga cardio rubix cubes and other hobbies to get sharper but its so hard to keep going because the struggle is way harder for a below average person like myself during mentally demanding activities i have other problems with myself but there are too many to count even physically i cannot stand myself i feel like a disappointment to my parents every time they look at me if literally anyone sees this please try and tell me what i can do to combat this because i am at a loss maybe a suggestion to boost myself mentally because that would give me more self confidence as i said though i am trying different hobbies but if you have any testimonials from your own experience or good insights to my kind of situation please comment i am starting to lose hope i want to kill myself because i am dumb i needed to get this out because i have been bottling up everything for 3 years nowi have felt horrible for the last 3 years now i am diagnosed with severe social anxiety anger issues adhd and autism3 years ago i got raped by a son of my dads friend i have not ever told anyone about this and still think about it every day and it just hurts so fucking much the next year while on vacation i was mad and out of rage i hit a window this cut into my artery and i almost bled out i still get flashbacks from this and never fully recovered due to covid i failed all my classes because i did not have any motivation and was severely depressed i just want for it to all be overit feels like nothing in my life is going well every time i am happy because i am with friends i zone out and think about all of the things stated above i just cannot deal with this anymoresidenote i am sorry if this is hard to read english is not my first language and i am very bad at talking about how i feel  this is what the government wants poor people to do and they win i will do it for them i do not get to go to schol because i am poor i am not gping to live in debt i give up i have to do something because i am poor i am tired should i should i end it i posted this in rdepression as well but i figure this would be more appropriate i always feel like i should not have any real reason to be depressed because i live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want however i have feelings of selfdoubt pity anxiety and a general low selfesteem most of the time i am 23 years old and i hate my life i graduated in mechanical engineering in august 2020 and i still have not found a job in my field this is partially the reason why my depression is bad i have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl i tried to talk to ended up ghosting me i do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day i cannot beat the depression no matter how hard i try i have followed every piece of advice i can take such as exercising eating well sleeping 8 hours a day getting sunlight and i still feel like a piece of shit more and morei would believe this might have to do with childhoodteenage trauma that i have had my brother was not the best person in my life which sucks becasue up to when i was 13 years old he was amazing and awesome afterwards he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse he gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if i was okay at home i was not but i did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation i told my parents but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother he left me in 15 temperature one time for a few hours where i was just wandering the neighbourhood i live fairly far from any store so i did not really have a shelter the thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends it makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karmathe next factor is the amount of bullying i received as a kid from my former friends surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend this friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone i became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well the bullying was not anything crazy just namecalling and making me look dumb a lot however they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me these kids are also super successful now and have great relationshipsi realized more in university how pathetic and below average i am to my peers everyone else can do things much more easier than i can have much more talents and are generally smarter than me i have extreme social anxiety and i always struggle showing my persoanlity around others maybe it is a defense mechanism and i will be betrayed again some good will hunting type of shit lol if it was not for tv shows and the internet i would be a lot more depressed than i am now i honestly believe i am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since i have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now thank you for reading this post if you have but if not i understand as welltldr i am killing myself in a month and i generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living killing myself soon because it is too easy to find a gf  no it is not maybe for you not for me not for a lot of people i beti will do it anyway because as you get older its even harder what is the point of living if you cannot get anything you want why should not i be depressed over being a virgin that cannot find a gf i have chronic health problems and pain i have 2 bad phobias i have anxiety and ocd symptoms i am lonely i am depressed my mom is dying i am suicidalmy anxiety and pain is crushing me i am decaying i am dying i am losing the fightmy mom has a really serious illness and she can die any moment and probably will not live long anymore she is the only person who cares about me nobody else gives a fuck she is also depressed and suicidal she has threatened suicide but said that she is still alive just beacuse of me she is the best mom everwe live in the middle of nowhere and covid did not change anything i have been living in this kind of isolation my whole life and i have no friends everyone thinks i am annoying i am going to a different school now and i know absolutely no one its a big school and i was in a really small school a huge change and facing it alone i am so damn scared i am probably going to get bullied beacuse of my appearence if i get bullied i am going to kill myself i am either anxious or in a neutral mood or i feel a strange mix of numbness and sadness i cannot enjoy life i am always thinking about this i cannot cry even if i wantedi have never actually got a full on anxiety attack but last night i took a knife and held it to my wrist i did not do anything i just sat there for a couple of minutes and then put away the knife i knew that there was no way i could die i would just had shredded my tendons and everything and fucked up my hand beacuse that is what usually happens when you slit your wrists and i really like drawing and a lot of other stuff i need my hands foras long as my mom lives i live if she dies i die i cannot live without her i really cannoteverytime i think about suicide i get really anxious and i want to cry but i once again cannotonly thing that keeps me going is writing lyrics and poems and stuff i really love it its one of the most important things for mesorry if this was unclear or had grammar mistakes english is not my first language and i am really tired i i fucking i do not even know anymore what to say ever since the uk had a large country lockdown thing last year my social life has gotten worse and sometimes i cannot even speak as i do not know what to sayrecently i have been getting more persistent suicidal thoughts and wanting to self harm thankfully my addiction to the internet has basically saved my life as i have found out what phobias are me having a phobia of death and pain really saves me from doing anything to hurt myself though at times i get serious thoughts but i try and consider the good things in life and turn to them for helpanother problem is that me and my parents have completely different views on mental health i think it is looked down upon to be mentally unstable and it should be talked about more my mum is a nurse who thinks she knows everything but she most certainly does not and lastly the worst of all my dad he tells me that i should not cry because its annoying anxiety is a stupid thing and it is all just a phase that i am not depressed i am just being a teenager speaking of what he says i am scared of him because he would shout at me all the time when i was little sometimes it was justified most of the time it was not and he tells me that i should be scared  he just does not understand that children are not supposed to be scared of their dadssorry this is long but next unfortunately on the subject of suicide i have attempted to commit suicide it was a couple months ago when i was in the bath i was listening to some what i call lucid dreaming sort of music and my family was downstairs watching the tv and nobody had checked on me in a while since my mum is always worrying because she knows i struggle with self harm thoughts i was wondering why she is not shouting up to me asking if i am okay it kind of just made me feel unwanted as all my family where laughing downstairs whilst this suicidal kid was in a bath by themselves  they could possibly decide to like  end it all suddenly i was just looking back on all the times i felt empty and i realised how much i was feeling that numb feeling i just decided to sink beneath the water it was not until reality set in that i ended up surfacing and thinking it all over i do not think some people would class this as an attempt but i think it isi know this is long i know i am sorry i just have a lot to say that i cannot say out loud or i am going to get grief some bad things in my life ever since the uk had a large country lockdown thing last year my social life has gotten worse and sometimes i cannot even speak as i do not know what to say recently i have been getting more persistent suicidal thoughts and wanting to self harm thankfully my addiction to the internet has basically saved my life as i have found out what phobias are me having a phobia of death and pain really saves me

some people would class this as an attempt but i think it isi know this is long i know i am sorry i just have a lot to say that i cannot say out loud or i am going to get grief some things wrong with my life but i just cannot stand the thought of living him behind gd its hard sometimes it really is if i did not have a dog i would probably kill myself right now its just miserable and i feel exhausted and like a burden i am tired of waiting for things to get better i know i have a lot to be grateful for and there have been some good memories but i have had enough there is been more despair and pain than moments of happiness i am afraid that i am losing myself even more as i try to stay here i am more depressed and cranky and isolated and i do not want people to know me like this its tiresome to keep trying to hide the amount of melancholy and desolation that i feel what is even the point of living if i am not even really living  i do not want to have a full life span id probably contribute the most to society by being dead and donating my organsidk why i am still waiting living feels like a slow form of suicide i have been extremely sad since last week and i cannot seem to get back to who i was before this i write draw and sing but i feel like at 26 its too late for me to make something of myself an internship i was looking forward to is not going to pan out due to covid my grandma is having major health troubles i cannot get ahold of my therapist and to top it off i started self harming yesterday i have dealt with suicidal ideation and self harming thoughts before but prior to yesterday id never actually done anything i am so ashamed and embarrassed i can usually talk to my mom about everything but i do not want to hurt her or have her think its her fault that i am hurting myself i have a dog named sam that i adore hes my world and taking care of him is one of my greatest joys he does not do well when i am out of the room he cries and cries i do not want him to miss me if i go and i worry about him looking for me and having a broken heart and not understanding why i left him i know he would be well taken care of because my family loves him dearly but the guilt is almost too much to bear i feel like a coward for not being able to go through with ending things and i hate how much stress i am putting my family through i do not know what to do i do not feel like i am worth having around i want to give up but i do not think i can tw selfharm whenever i have a bad day its always the first thing to pop into my head the answer to every problem all at the same time some days i get very depressed and i think about it basically all day but for some reason i am still here almost every night when i lay in bed its always on my mind keeping me awake what would happen if i did it would people genuinely miss me would i ruin my families lives by doing it would the memory of me just fade away would people genuinely feel sad or just surprised the sad reality of it all is that even if i do it these questions would remain unanswered which is the hardest part of it all i romanticize suicide all the time i have made it my be all end all solution to everything in life i want to die again please talk to me i am just fee up of everything everything and everyone pisses me off and i have tried to be happy but that just does not work i have made plans of suicide for sometime after i pass my driving test and get a car its the only thing i can think of i have tried self harm but i am too scared of pain thought about jumping off a building like my brother tried but i am a coward and anything else is too painful or i am scared to do it i know i have not passed my gcses because i did not try so i probably will not be able to get into college i am so negative to everyone around me i am scared i am losing friends everything about me is just a fucking waste anyone else could have been born in my place and done better children are dying in impoverished countries who could have had great potential but people like me were born who are selfish and useless i do not even know what to titke this i finally decided to talk to the suicide prevention chat and it did not even work pathetic suicide chat not working my mother died of drug addiction my brothers abusive and wants me dead my sister barely sees me my dad was never there since birth all my friends and family are either not in my life or pushing me away and i am living in chronic pain with several physical and mental health conditions what is left to live for ill only be hated and prolong my suffering i am going to kill myself soon everybodys dead and gone and my health is still declining i am going to end it soon unless you have magical power please do not drift away from the questions hanging is the best method i can think of right now considering that i have no access to a gun still pretty creeped out if there is not an easier alternative i guess i will have to do it this way i want to end it but i am afraid what to do or more specifically how to do it i want to know how to commite suicide i want to fall asleep and die i looked on the internet and i cannot find anything please help suicide i have great family around me sometimes good friends too but sometimes the way people treat you makes you feel alone i also have never found love i am 23 and i hope the time left means there is hope but when i treat people with kindness and interest i never seem to receive it back and it breaks me does anyone feel suicidal because they feel unloved my life is horrible but the one thing i wish i could change was my height i am 19 so i will not grow anymore i feel like i need to end my life being a short male is unattractive point blank period clothing looks better on tall people short men look like kids i fucking hate this shit i need to fucking end it already i am not depressedsuicidal just because of my height but its a huge part how people have treated me about my lack of attractiveness feeling undatable like the only way i will get to be with someone is if i date someone mentally unstable or disabled like that is what my worth is it makes me suicidal it makes me feel like my worth is down to who others think i should be with people do not know what it feels like to be so agonisingly alone constantly day in and out ruthlessly but then as soon as i spend time with people i cannot wait to be alonei just want this fucking bullshit to end is it worth killing myself because i truly believe ill never find love i was suicidal a while ago since i got out of it i have had a pretty decent life  but sometimes somewhere deep down i want to go back to being suicidal and it feels like my brain deep down enjoyed being suicidal it is really fucked upis there anyway to stop this or am i just mentally fucked i think i liked being suicidal i cannot even cry or get angry i am just in awe that this sort of feeling exists today the amount i want to die is unlike anything i have ever experienced before i was wondering if anyone knew how badpainful dying from hypoglycemia is i have been thinking about how i could best off myself and thought about insulin i do not have diabetes but my family members do so i have unlimited access to insulin i know what happens but is it painful thank you suicide via insulin overdose it is been along time and i have litterally been seconds away from killing myself but yeah i want to thank all of my friends for trying to support me but i guess this is my suicide note i am going to write one right now on a piece of paper and yeah i am ending my life fuck man goodbye i do not see the point of staying aliveits been over 10 years of depression now i think that sadness and despair brings more beautifull things than anything elsei know that i should help but tbh i am afraid of every people sorry if you answer to this post i might be afraid of youwith time i got the fear of everyone and anything i do not have friends since a long time i do not have family only my mother who talks to me by cupabilityi do not understand why i am writing this and why i should get a better mental healthsince it is been a long time i just live this as an experimentation asking myself how much time i could hold all this shit in me without killing myselfsince 2 years i have a lot of panic attacks i do not have friends anymore i do not want any gf anymorei do not know why i am posting it i honnestly thinks that you should not help me going to delete this post if i can soon anyway you can skip this post like really not joking i cannot even string sentences together or deliver my thoughts coherently nobody wants me around i do not have the ability to form connections so i am on the outside of society i literally cannot go an hour without thinking about how much of a degenerative pos i actually am the only silver lining about this life is that ill be dead some time in the future hopefully that will be soon what is the point of life if you have no basic social skills my mom will not let me transition i am transgender and i am feeling suicidal someone bullied me on twitter a few hours ago and that was the last straw for me i just do not know how to convince myself to keep living i want to live but i cannot keep on being someone i am not i tried to end it all last night but it did not work i just woke up today feeling high from all the drugs and alcohol i took  i am probably going to jail next month 14 years for something i did not do but my lawyer wants me to accept the plea bargain i just do not see the point in life anymore i am only 22 but i just want to die i have no friends and no hope of achieving anything anymore i watched my older brother die of cancer last month and wish it was me instead of him the universe is one fucked up place death is easy unless you fucking want it  i am tired man i just do not feel like doing anything anymore the only thing i actually look forward to is getting high i am not interested in anything and to be completely honest the very process of learning new things has become a burden to me the only thing that keeps me going is that by doing the bare minimum i am able to maintain a lifestyle where all i have to do is show up at work and do a good enough job and afterwards i can just get high and have a place to go home to everything is a burden learning how to socialize is a burden socializing is in fact the heaviest burden in my life everything i just said could be completely directed at simply learning how to socialize and that alone would be reason enough for me to be over and done with lifei am tired of trying tobecome the best version of myself i am tired of having to greet people awkwardly over and over again just to get better at it i am tired of trying to use body language or my own voice in a communicative manner i am tired of fighting my brain and forcing it to at least pretend to be interested in another person i am tired of having to fight all of the automatic negative thoughts whenever i have to interact with another human beingi am never going to what i want out of life because of all this so why even live my motivation is all gone and i am just not capable of enjoying other people i would rather just go to sleep forever than have to something i do not want to do anything with my life so what is the point so instead i am going to listen to music drink and hope it goes away or gets worse if it gets worse maybe i will be able to have the will to do something about it i cannot seem to untangle the thoughts and feelings i have been having suicidal ideation nearly every day for the past few years and the older i get the worse it gets at this point killing myself feels inevitable i am taking a break from school and my student loans will be due soon which has been making me feel like i have to just do it my parents took out tens of thousands in parent loans as well and considering i do not have a degree or a well paying job there is no way i could possibly help to pay it back and how could i ask them to pay for that when they already are only just scraping by killing myself has always felt like the way things will end for me as i have a lot of trouble connecting with people and i really do not want to be alone for another fifty plus years that being said it has always felt far away so now with my student loans looming i feel like its probably coming to be time and its freaking me out a bit to be honest i have no one to discuss this with my mom yelled at me when i had tried to discuss this with her a few years ago so i just needed to write this and put it somewhere sorry if i have broken any rules of this sub i have never been here before feels inevitable at this point just want to know can i od on concerta if so how much do i need to take main problems are sharp pains in liver throughout the day constant loss of consciousness for two days after my overdose and my breathing has been a bit more laboured also wrenching a bit and feeling a bit sick i am most concerned about the liver pains as they are consistent and actually make me say ouch occasionally and i have a high pain threshold my liver just does not feel right after this it was a busy night when i did what i did and i did not feel like a pain to the nurses but probably was to the doctor who could not understand why i was not immediately reacting the way he wanted me to well i actually did i just seemed to have a delayed reaction to the drugs i took for whatever reason i am worried about my liver i took a pretty high dosage and i do not understand why it took a day to react just a couple hours before i was meant to be leaving hospital i started to strongly react to the medication i took i had all the symptoms then i spent the two days immediately after taking the overdose getting all of the worst symptoms a bit while hospitalised and mostly not the medication was out of date and there for if i ever needed to kill myself i would have been smarter doing this a different way because now i have no idea what i have done sometimes i do not care then i get a sharp pain in my liver and do not like the idea of dying slowly of cirrhosis i suppose most people who want to die would rather just take a painless route but those are basically unavailable unless you really know what you are doing i am having pains after overdose i was hospitalised for a few days ago i am scared of how they will react if i tried to kill myself like would they be angry at me or themselves would they be sad i do not know i wish i had another reason though literally anything a pet something i do not know my parents are the only thing keeping me alive i met my bf at my job that is for mentally ill people he is 19 and i am 29 he asked me out and i said maybe i will think about it i then said ok and we have been together for almost a year i am autistic bpd and intellectual disability my bf is autistic dyslexic with depression he told me he loves me and bought me a ring to marry him i said yes he wants kids i do tomany people disapprove of this and say i am dating child or i am predator or i should know better i do not know anymore i do not know what i am and might be best to die so others will be happy i am not sure what to do so i will be committing suicide soon i have been suicidal for years this is just one reason am i a bad person i have been experiencing an increasingly hellish hell for many years and i am closely nearing the end of what i have the strength to bear i have money saved to purchase a few acres of land in another state but my depression anxiety and confusion of navigating the adult world has thus far hindered me in making this longheld dream a reality too scared of making a mistake scared of risk and change even if it is change for the better something i know i want deep down so to stimulate motivation i have made a pact of life and death with myself if i fail to aquire a new home by the latest deadline of this upcoming december 31st i will take my own life by opiate overdose in a motel room on january 5th of next year probably sometime in the evening it does not help that i want to die anyway a death pact is hardly a motivator when you are already suicidal it seems like ending my own existence would be easier and a more certain win than anything else i have ever done as it seems as though my hopes and dreams are nothing but shattered shards of failure and regret i want to see beauty in life a reason to keep living but darkness is blotting it all out now i hope things change soon they have to or i am going to die if my moving plan is not successful by the end of the year i am killing myself january 5th 2022 i have been changing numbers constantly just lately among other stuff i have been doing or not doing due to this feelings that i got during a very toxic relationship i was doin better before it but the shame and guilt i got out of this just took me many steps back into the dark i used to walk in i do not really know what i felt what i am feeling i just feel i am done its weird because during the course of it i felt pity i felt scared i felt sorry but mostly ashamed and guilty i still think i could have avoid all of this i do not have any energy left on me i used to be a huge player and the fact that i was reminded and worse constantly manipulated and tested and lied to did not help me a lot yet i still feel this emptiness again its not the person and my mom blames me she says i am spoiled i do what i want but its not like that i just want to end it end all the pain i cannot take it anymore i feel like in the past couple of months i have started over and over and over and over from scratch and i cannot stand up again it just hurts so much like either its all my fault or i am just the victim which also somehow makes it even worse like how stupid i need to be to be usedlike that i do not got answers to any of these questions and its been like this all my life just different characters to the same twisted plot i do not know the thoughts are coming back i am feeling suicidal again i do not know how much more i can take it is happening again well for some reason i am still alive but with my body completely sore i do not know what to think i cannot stop thinking about the miserable beautiful memories of people who really seemed to love me and it was a lie i do not understand why it is so difficult to have someone maybe if i deserve it but i am tired of being alone i no longer think i have a way to redeem myself and knowing that the person i thought loved me told me that he does not want to know anything more about me only makes me want to jump out of the window or sleep and dream something impossible with it again welp i am still alive hooray got called ugly 5 more times last night and a few days before got called it by another girl thanks guys just more reasons to put lead in my head i will not tho ugly hiis there a way to decide who is your closest family or relative legally i do not want anyone to be involved when i am dead except for the authorities i live in sweden and some tips about how to fix this would be appreciatedthanks in advance family membersrelatives land full of racist sexist homophobic pieces of shit why the fuck was i born in this country i hate having to associate with the villains in history this fucking land does not even belong to us this nation was founded by the suffering and genocide of others i do not even know anymore i have just fucking had it and i might as well kill myself to rid the world of one more white person fuck america i do not want to explain why but i cannot find peace in this world i do not desire happiness i just want my thoughts to stop and i want to stop my emotions from wanting more and more no pain no happyness nothing that is what i want but i am so scared i want to find peace lost my dog on monday he was always my brother and best friend  my everything i have spent more time with him on this earth than without him i love and miss him so so fucking much already he was without doubt the best thing that ever happened to me and i would do anything in the world to bring him back fuck i would do everything to just have one more fucking minute with him it hurts so much to go to bed without him to wake up without him i have been suicidal for years and there were a few times where i was insanely close to ending it all but now i am for once glad that i did not kill myself it would have just shortened our time together even more in all these years i have never felt this much pain before i just want to hug him and be with him it breaks my heart not to be able to know whether he is okay whether he is safe whether he is alone i want to be with him so bad the thought of never being able to hold him in my arms again tears me up insidei cannot kill myself because of my sister but if it was not for her i would do it in a heartbeat why do the best ones have to go i have typed and rewritten this 100 times its embarrassing but here goes why cannot i kill myselfmy life is a long story filled with ups and downs but since i was a child i had my best friend with me in highschool he and i started dating and 2 years ago we got married we had no one but each other a lot of years were just us vs the world and it felt amazing coming home to him everyday but then i found out i was pregnant in may since then he completely changed he has cheated twice now with two different girls i caught him both times i have no family no friends i lost my job i told my therapist what is happening and she asked why i am even seeing her still i stopped going to therapy and i am sick of them not helping i decided i want to end my life while i am pregnant i know that sounds macabre and evil i know but no one will love the baby but me i do not want her to grow up feeling as alone and unwanted as me i decided to do it several days ago i have my notes one for my husband one for my mom written out every day for 3 days now i sit down in the bed take a blood thinner say goodbye to my cat and lay out the notes but one i grab the knife i just freeze i usually stay like that until 3 when i hear my husband pull up and put everything away this feels like the right thing to do but i just cannot do it i do not know what to do anymore or what hope i am holding onto what should i do why cannot i do it like its so easy take a bunch of pills and everythings over no more stress no more pain no more anxiety no more being fat its just over the temptation to kill myself rn what do you think the easiest way to do it is without your raw human survival instincts to counter it cutting your wrists and throat i feel like can back forever a gun pulling away at the last second how many pills and what kind would you need do you need to mix the pills with alcohol how strong of a rope is needed to hang how small of a room do you need by sticking your head in the oven i have failed alot in life this is the one thing i do not want to fail at struggling with the method 24m have been thinking about offing myself for about half a year now nothing that brings joy nothing to live for i have a job and i do like it but when i do not work i just smoke and drink my brain away how do you find hapiness bad nights i feel like if i had a gun in front of me it would be as easy as pulling a tooth and that just makes me feel like crying even more i cannot cope all i want is to be loved genuinely and unconditionally why do i have to get better for them to finally love me how do i tell them that there is nothing wrong with me this is just who i am and i am so sorry i wish i was anything or anyone else i am sorry i would be so much more lovable if i were dead sorry my english is pretty bad i just broke up with my boyfriend bc a therapist said i have bpd and i have lost everything and every goals and plans a had in my lifei have lost my job i started learning to get my driving license but i had to stop it i have lost my friends mostly my bfs friends i have lost him and our cats and also my goals and plans about learning to get better job plans of marrying him having kids getting old togetherwe lived together in a house so i had to move back to my grandparents but they do not like i am here they do not even care what is up with mei really lost every of my hope to live my friends still telling me to move on and stuff but i just cannot live like this i am not strong enoughidk what should i dopls do not be mean with me i want to kill myself bc i feel like i have lost everything from the outside i appear to be successful i moved up in the corporate world quickly and at an early age i also have my own business that does well none of it means anything it all just makes me feel more stuck in my current circumstances and life truth is i have been suicidal for over a year i have letters written plans in place but i just cannot commit to a date i have no idea how to get out of this pointless life there is no point to any of this work yourself to death so that you can retire then die suicide honestly seems to be a logical short cut when you weigh the years of work and sacrifice vs the ones your supposed to enjoy later in life i came close a few months back but could not follow through i am even more determined now though every day is just a chore and i do not see the benefit on the other side of it all i used to be healthy and really active i cannot even get motivated to leave the house any more my lifestyle has deteriorated into a substance abuse binge eating loop i am pretty well finished with all this i am successful but suicidal as hell they say suicide is selfish but if i decide why cannot i have the option to die peacefully after a certain age is not it selfish for everyone to prefer me suffering everyday rather than being peacefully dead like if i decide to die do not make me search for weird non guaranteed ways that can leave me seriously crippled give me some amount of mandatory therapy and if a still want to after that let me go i genuinely do not get why i need to live i do not want help i want to die it really seems like my place in life is just to get hurt again and again no matter what i try suffering just finds me somehow every year for the past 10 years has been gradually worse and i am done with hope and positivity i do not have any dreams or goals in my lifesometimes i feel like an old person looking back at life i do not believe i will achieve or experience anything new in my life i am crippled by my mental illness and trauma and it feels bitter to realize that this is what my life has become all that trying and achieving in school is worth nothing i see no end in my suffering apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense i am feeling emotional and i am also a bit highi have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks have a history of attempts and i think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until i do something about them ie try to off myself and today i have been seriously considering doing it again and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right dog would be taken care of and i had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon but ambivalencesomy dilemma is that if i am rational enough to think that i should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital er then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself so then why am i even at the er but if i do not take myself there it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a should i or should not i kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong which is not necessarily any time soon based on recent history or i am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive and i know i would just fail again and i cannot deal with more of that flavour of shamei know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal so i am not asking whether you think i should go to the hospital or not but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation i usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since i went to er and i am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go i do not want to feel like a moron telling them i am there because i do not want to kill myself and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term i already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like i need them to connect me with that resource but going it alone when i am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes \\u200btldr when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it what did you do how did it work out need thoughts on going to the er or not this is not even really living at this pointi feel dead when i am awake i just hurt so i do my best to be awake as little as possiblei hope one day ill snap out of it maybe its all a dreambut sadly i do not think that is the caseeverything hurtseverything fucking hurtshow can you just do this to mei hope you are happymeanwhile ill keep fantasizing about ways to kill myself i can barely keep my eyes open i do not want to leave behind all this clutter for someone else to have to clean up it is the only thing that gives me pause when i am right on the brink of acting i feel like i will either clean it up soon and have nothing stopping me or just get so far down into this pit of darkness that i will not care anymore what happens after i am gone i am only alive because my house is a mess when i was a teenager and i first started experiencing being suicidal the internet was a treasure trove of information how to do this where to get that and forums full of discussion now that i am an adult and i have my own time and money to finally come up with a plan to end my life the internet is wiped clean i can find none of this precious info i skimmed through so long ago i know things have changed a lot and the removal of all of these sites posts and resources is for everyone is safety but i feel so frustrated i am at a dead end i do not know how to kill myself the lethality of different methods or where to get anything i might need i kick myself for not taking past opportunities for easier ways to end my life now i must find some very painful way as all other methods are not an option anymore i hate that i cannot have genuine conversations on how to kill myself because its taboo i feel so so lost the internet used to tell me how to kill myself now its blank i do not know if this subreddit is for me but i want to kill myself really badly i have an eating disorder for almost half a decade now and its been all over the place i have never been fully diagnosed but half a year ago i was still sick but skinnier since then now i gained like 7kg which does not seem much and i can just work it off but i keep eating and i never was really suicidal but now i am actually considering i know it seems strange but i feel this huge self hatred for the fact i cannot seem to control my intake anymore and that makes me so crazy and sad because i know i can just lose it but i cannot seem to do it and it feels like i lost my mind i feel like this is such a rude reason to attempt suicide because others seem to have it harder and i should be grateful which i am however this is keeping me from living like i want to and be the person i desire to become the problem is that i have to eat everyday but i cannot without feeling extrem guilt and hatred while eating more i feel out of control and it makes me not take care of myself because i do not want to shower due to my body i habe a bmi of 20 which is normal but i feel morbidly obese i know i might cone across as rude i do not intend to be my eating disorder is making me suicidal 26m i have been thinking about suicide a lot lately i am unsure of what went wrong in my life for me to even think this way but i do not feel like i am living i already feel dead i have never had a girlfriend and will probably never find love which is pretty much all anyone needs i am a virgin i am ugly i am broke i have never even been called attractive by a woman and its starting to weigh really heavily on me that ill probably never find a love i am unloveable and unwanted and if this is all life has to offer me i am better off dead so people do not have to put up with me being sad and a waste of space all the time my heart really hurts and i am not having fun here i have been thinking about suicide hello everyone lolcurrently sitting outside in the pouring rain in horrible pain hoping my pain relief kicks in yayi honestly do not even know where to start anymorelike the title says my life just gets worsei constantly wonder what would have happened if i completed high school yes i know i am working on my gedanywaysi hate myself for not standing up for myself in school and not doing more with my life i am not ugly or obese so that is cool i guessi definitely got worse mentally being that now i have chronic pain that at times is completely debilitating and other times i feel like a normal person which is a total mindfucki do not think i am stupid but i feel like i have nothing and am nothing but a body full of pain and miseryi am poor i am glad i am not homeless of coursei also share a room with my mom and do not even have a door to my bedroom door broke off awhile ago and sharing a room sucks obviously loli am also a virgin and cannot even fucking drivehave a permit or license i even confronted my dad today about it and said i have to be mature to drive yet my dad is a drug addict who does nothing and can do whatever he wantsi can keep going but i guess i will stop thereanyway in the shit show called my life my dreams of cosmetology school are crushed being that i need to survive especially with this painand need 247 bathroom accessit is not like i do not try either tried therapy did not work at all typical it will get better bullshitand bringing up my chronic pain was a fucking joke tooi do have hobbies i enjoy like drawingpaintingmakeupphotographypoetryand scrapbooking even though i feel like i suck at all of thatit is such a joke now even the fucking chronic pain groups ignore mealso please do not tell me about therapydietingmeditationor fucking celery juice bullshitanyways i just hope i can find someone who can relate to me or possibly even make me feel less of a piece of shit my life just gets worse every other day i feel like everyone is problems would be solved if i did not exist i have been hearing voices for about six months now and overtime the ones that use to be comforting when i was anxious have started telling me that everyone around me is lying to me about everything and my family is the only safe group of people but even now they are telling me that my family would be safer if i was not around my dad just quit his job and i have a distinct feeling that by me existing near them i am endangering them in some way i am on medication as of the last couple days but i have been going in this circle for months now i feel okay for a few hours slowly get worse and by the next day i am one weird look from a stranger away from ending everything i cannot do this anymore i am exhausted i do not even know why i bother to keep fighting the urge to leave the feeling just comes back and it comes back a little worse everytime music has been helping but now i can hear songs playing over eachother when i try to listen for too long everything is crumbling around me i feel like i am melting into my surroundings what do i do cannot keep going in circles anymore last year i had the worst day of my life march 15 2020 i was across the country in my dream grad program i was two days into a semester and my colleagues from all around the country and i were all enamored with each others brilliance id never felt so connected to another group of people two days and four hours into the semester the sudden spike of covid19 deaths caused my school to shut down and send us all home for the past year i have been separated from my flock and last week we were reunited at last this week has been everything i dreamed of for the past year and my vaccinated friends and i are soaking in each others presence today the bomb dropped again due to the increase in the delta variant we are being sent home again i had a ptsd flashback to the first time we were sent home and could not get ahold of myself every time i am here it is far too brief and it is even more painful to say goodbye this time i was to graduate next week and my classmates and i will likely never see each other again now i am suddenly going home to no job because that too is once again suspended due to the delta variant because of the unvaccinated people in my country i am forced to lose out on the only thing that gave my life any meaning anymore and i am being forced to relive the most traumatic day of my life its hard to see the point anymore and i am thinking of ending it all when i get home i cannot do this again i was unable to cry for months idk what went wrong but i did not felt anything for months piled it up i was not doing well still does not feel good i feel horrible but a little bit better tried my best to cry forced it cried for like 1015 mins eyes got pretty tired from it though physical weakness and the need to take a nap will help me to distract myself i was planning a way to suicide and it is really hard to pick a method felt so stressed out when i saw it is not easy to end this pain i cannot keep this anymore that stress was there used it brought some old memories back and cried it out i guess some sleep will help to clear the rest whatever it is just one day tomorrow will be worse it is just one day crying helped hi i am 21 starting my junior year in college and i am currently on vacation well while at the pool by myself just enjoying the wonderful florida sun these rich kids i guess they were about my age came up beside me and started calling me names like a stupid fgot a fat ass i do not remember the rest why are people so cruel to each other i have worked for months to she would the weight which i was at and i am genuinely proud of that but when people say that i want to just jump off a bridge i used to be obese now i am just overweight and i am proud of that i have lost nearly 40 pounds then they talk about how i was dressed and it was just a lot i got up and came back to my condo where i am now just bawling my eyes out like i am not gay but if it was is that an insult like i am so confused i did not ask to be here so why do people consistently make it worse i do not know those guys and what they go through but are not it some shit that they can be born affluent talk about people get whatever they want in life and still live a happy life i do not get it fuck this world i do not want to be in it i hate existing i am the because of all of the worlds problems and the worst person ever i murdered millions of people by causing the pandemic i should die by lethal injection no feeling at all i am completely numb i have not felt anything but anger in a long time and while that is sustained me for quite awhile it to is starting to fade one day soon there will be nothing left of me but an empty she will devoid of any human emotion when i heard about the children who were murdered at the residential schools i did not feel any emotion my aunt died a few years ago and i felt nothing people tell me they love me but i do not love them back this is not a life what i am doing right now is just existing at its most basic level and i am tired of it existing without being fully alive is a horrible experience and i cannot do it much longer i know that my suicide will be devastating for my family and that is why i have hung around this long but i cannot continue existing just for other peoples sake i do not feel anything anymore i will just introduce a biti am 21 years oldcurrently on an internship away from homei have struggled with depression on and off but lately suicidal thoughts have been worse than usualit keeps returningevery morning i just want to put a gun to my head and pull the trigger every night before i go to bed same thingi will be honest if it were not for my lovely parents i would have done it i feel lonely i feel like there is avoid inside of mei work in hospitality and with childrenand i can smile temporarily when i can bring people a good time but i just feel like my smile is not going to last foreveri feel like i am rotting away on the inside and i just do not know what to do with iti have been procrastinating on my school assignments i just want to lay in bed but even that is starting to be invaded by my suicidal thoughtsi just do not know anymorewhat do i do with it why does it keep returning its finally hit me that i am growing up and i cannot just have fun and do whatever i want anymore i have always been smart  have a loving functional family a safe home my life is good my life is great its beautiful but that is it i have become nothing every year i grew older i lost more and more i do nothing but sleep or draw all day my room is full of dust and bugs i am good for nothing and tbatse fine because i do not want to do anythingeryrhinf around me is beautiful but my mind is so fucking ugly and its going to tear me apart just turned 16 i feel like my life is already over but it will not end  so i have to do it myself this has been a long time coming i have had depression since i was 9 years old and i am 28 now turning 29 in november i have decided to end it on the 20th anniversary how can that be i am not sure but when i look back at my life all i see are fleeting moments of happiness followed by long periods of misery my family might find this so i am not going to mention them but the time has come after all my attempts to get help to get on medication to try coping strategies i just cannot do it anymored today for the millionth time i called out of work because i cannot take the pressure today for the millionth time i turned down a guy online bc all men see me for is a good time my overall depression leads to my lack of motivation which is why i keep losing jobs i am pathetic and worthless i am both lonely and alone i have decided to call 911 right before and do it while my roommate is away i am hoping my last days will be good ones i am ready its wrong its a humiliation do not make me keep living today was the first time i really thought about suicide i have often thought through my life about death and imagined dying and have said things like i wish i was not alive to myself multiple times a day and have so for many years but this was sort of a coping mechanism i think to deal with stress i have been pretty successful in life and probably happy by a lot of peoples standards in general i have been pretty driven and interested i was clinically depressed about 15 years ago but i have not had a similar episode sincehowever today i felt a really different feeling when my usual thought came for the day i did not just think i do not want to be alive i thought maybe i will not be soon i thought of some familiar fantasy of dying but this this time it was real life i thought about how i could enact that fantasy then i wondered if that was really a realistic way to die i do not want to die painfully and i do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards so i spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate making dinner talking to my spouse putting the kids to bedi just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing i did to cope with how stressed i was feeling to this other oh i can do this feeling it was so unexpected it was just a normal dayi have never had these thoughts before and i just wanted to write it down somewhere i found this subreddit in the course of the day and i have reddit so i thought it would be as good a place as any july 28 2021 maybe a new era in my life started today for reasons i cannot really understandthanks for listening today was the first time i really thought about suicide untill now i was the so called good guy always trying to be pleasant around others always trying to help always saying thank you and you are welcome when needed etc recently i decided to adopt and raise a cat but there is something very dark that came to the surface which i did not know that existed and i have the very hard to resist temptation to hurt my cat watch her squeal in fear as i am being a total piece of shit to her first few weeks were great i may have been rough to her sometimes during those weeks but it was nothing too serious we were always sleeping together playing together and we were practically inseparable she was happy and i was happy toobut once i decided to return to the house i grew up in where some childhood trauma events have occurred it was like a switch flipped and i became a monster i became very abusive towards my cat and i have a very hard time stopping now i try to keep her outside my room and encourage her to hide because there is a monster inside me which i cannot controland because of that i feel like i do not deserve anyone in my life i was being a hypocrite all along pulling of an act and i deserve to be alone hell i feel so guilty that i want to outright die because i cannot live with the guilt and shame because of thisi know there will be people who will hate me for what i said and i am really scared because of what i am about to post but then again i have never done the right choice anywayi deserve the hate i am lost i never thought it is possible but i have a case of mental illness that is practicaly incurable it is based on only severe emotional neglect through childhood and adulthood but when it is mixed up with too much responsibility from early age it becomes incurablei will explain normally in therapy patients are taught to find their inner child and nurture it the way patients have not been nurtured this gives the restless inner child fixing experiences and after few years of inner child work mental health gets better but if you are neglected and you had to take care of yourself taking care of your inner child is just playing the trauma again so it is not healing it is only retraumatizingand this mixture means constant paniclike feelings like what a baby would feel when left on the side of the road panic fear chaos eventually deathwish these feelings might be on the surface or hide in dark but they are never absent therefore i do not sleep i do not enjoy i do not connect i do not love there is no hope of feeling nurtured or satisfied unless someone else does the parentification and since i am not adoptable minor that means never so do you know any cults with charismatic fatherfigures can be a suicide cult incurable mental pain even though we have never met i love and care for you with my whole heart i am sorry i am not there to bare with you in the pain your facing one day one day well be free from this hell but not today just get one more day in remember this anytime something bad happensmy brain this is what you deserve you horrible person you should not exist you should kill yourself to alleviate your burden on others idiotanytime something good happensmy brain you do not deserve this i hate you you should kill yourselfi literally can never win i hate myself nsfwi have been depressed since a child i watched my grandfather die at age 4 of a heart attack in front of me i was sexually assaulted by my neighbors and age 7 my bio dad passed away when i was 12 one of my

issues and the pandemic i had not seen my mother the last time i saw her alive was in early december at my aunts funeral that was the last time i hugged her and held her handforward to march and i lost another aunt she lost her battle with leukemiathere is more death and many other reasons but my main trigger has been deathloss i have cried because i am tired of living and want to end my life i get angry that i have kids because i am afraid of what my loss will do to them and my wife especially after already losing a brother and recently losing two aunts and our mother i am afraid of what would happen to my brothers if i kill myselfbut the desire is increasing everyday i am miserable in a miserable marriage with a wife that does not get me and cares solely that her needs physical touch are not being meti am just ready to leave life behind death cannot come soon enough did not kms the rope was too short started drinking instead update 2 i like to think that i am a proactive person i believe that if you have unexplored options you do not have a right to complain but this is the second time in my life where i feel like i have absolutely no options left i tried so many ways to be happy and to survive in the past year and they all failed spectacularly or simply evaporated the crazy thing is that it is not even my fault i did everything i could its the pandemic it is the economy it is our slowass indecisive bureaucracies it is everyone being sad at the exact same timei am talking to a military recruiter soon because i feel like it is my only option left in order to have any level of economic security but everything else failed so what is keeping this from not working out too i have already come really close to killing myself in the past month and a half i do not want to feel trapped i do not want to feel like i do not have any options just to simply live when you feel trapped you are always one step away i do not want to be there feeling trapped i have always believed that life is meaningless and that at some point i will end up killing myself i do not know when or why i just know no sense this needs to go on longer i will be able to end it then just need a push to overcome instincts i hope someone i care about tells me to kill myself numb we go shopping very rarely and i have not gotten new clothes since i went clothes shopping with my dad a couple years ago my stepdad hates me and i know it we go shopping and everyone yes something but me he favors his kids and wife i am so done with life i absolutely hate it here everyone we go out i end up crying he makes me want to end my life i hate my family i no longer want to live anymore i honestly have no idea what i am hanging on for i am so tired of this feeling of emptiness i just want to be loved but i know now that is a pipe dream i am objectively ugly and any chance i get to make friends i push it away i am so scared that i will not be good enough i am not good enough for my parents my home life is shit i do not have any friends i am annoying and selfish i am tired i am 16 so this is my first time posting on reddit apologies if i mess up to make a long story short i failed my first year of college my parents are okay people they have done some bad stuff to me in the past but i know they love me so i try to not put it against them so my dad took out a loan to help me pay for college thing is after covid restrictions my mental health went down way down i was hardly showing up to my online classes hardly doing assignments i failed most of my classes both semesters i am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides but i did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this they are going to pay off the loan today and its killing me inside i do not know if they will find out i failed this year or not but either way i feel that i am such a horrible child even if i cannot help my mental illness i could have reached out i do not even want to go to college anymore i do not want my parents to dump so much money on my stupid suicidal ass i want to die so they do not have to pay off my loans i cannot go on i feel like a walking failure for not just doing my work why did not i do it what is wrong with me i hate myself so much why cannot i just be a good child to my parents i cannot do anything right so i feel like the only way to repent is to die any advice is appreciated i am such a horrible child not suicide per se but sometimes i imagine myself just blinking out of existencejust gone at this point i do not feel right anymore but i do not know how to explainarticulate what is going onmostly of people i tried to they told me i am being dramatic that i am attention seeking because i do not have the right to feel this empty and sad that i have a family that loves me talent more than them and that they have it worsei do not even know why i feel like this sadly i am a coward and i doubt i would end it i cannot ask if they would care if i disappeared because they get offendedsometimes i just want to leave everything start again sometimes i fantasize about disappearing as a depressed person who happens to be dating another severely depressed person i feel lost i do not even want to live myself but it pains me even more to see her become even more self destructive i care about her a lot and it hurts having to constantly hear her talk about how she plans to kill herself i do not know how to help her i do not even know how to help myself but i cannot just do nothing does anyone have any advice advice for what to say to my suicidal partner 32 years of fight and i have not got another round in me i give up  i throw in the towel i thought having my son 7 years ago would give me enough purpose but that bad seed in my brain just keeps growing what was the point of any of this game over been through some very bad times and wondered what others do to feel betternumber one choice  to vent to someone well not many has that so i decided to start a shop this is my new shop iventthis is day 3cost is a bit a patience and possibly a lot of friendshipim a guy idk if it matters but ik people have their own need and comfort zone i am open to everything every discussion every vent  anything you can throw at meand remember ily and here is a hug  how do you free hugs  people make fun of me because i am lonely i do not talk to people and it is embarrassing i want to be dead being lonely is so embarrassing sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as i am not a native speaker most of my english comes from memes and series i am 25 years old male big loser with no education and living in a shit hole i have been depressed since i have been concious and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that i feel like i cannot take it anymore my father was not present when i was a kid and because my mom had to take care of me alone she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid the absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot and while i despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant i can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts i was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis it was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day after that i started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me this was when i was 9 yo at my 11 years of age i was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me the experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then all of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner and i wonder if the sexual abuse that i suffered earlier has to do with that i deserted my undergrad mechatronics because i was scared of failing again in life and running always seemed easier and safer i deeply regret this now that i am older but it is too late to go back now i am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty with no education no good jobs prospects nothing i was very close to end my life a few days ago but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and i broke down into tears and told her everything and she convinced me to not do it i have never tried suicide before but that day i was completely commited to end my life violently and for good my current relationship is long distance she is in another country with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident because of my lack of education and preparation it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is we met when we were younger in the current country that i live in and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that i did not know back then and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again yea i know that this was a very bad decision i have decided that i am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there my options are limited and i fucking hate life so why not this was a decision i made before i got into this relationship but now that i am compromised with someone and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing it really sounds ridiculous she says that she is deeply in love with me and would do anything to be together i feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me i also deeply love her and i do not think i could forgive myself ever i want to end my life i do not think i can fix my situation and even so the temptation of killing myself will ever go away i am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life and it seems that i am about to just make it more miserable for her i hope that my mother girlfriend and friends could forgive me but maybe that is asking for too much i definitely do not deserve any of that thank you for reading my story am at my wits end thinking about death feels like peace i am 19 and i feel like i have wasted the best years of my life when i was younger i was extremely shy and scared of everything i was scared of talking to people at my school and talking to girls even though i was not ugly or something when i went to highschool i did not really enjoy going to partys with people i did not know so i partied with my closest friends now when i have finished highschool i know that i wasted that time i wish i was more outgoing not so shy and did not spend so much time at home i know that there is a lot of younger people here so i want you to stop worrying and enjoy this time ask herhim out you have got nothing to lose you will get rejected so what stop dreaming about things that can happen and actually do something to make them happen i wish i asked eve out i did not do it but i knew that she was into me maybe i was wrong i would get rejected i do not care start living and maybe one day you will not feel like me teenager with no teenagers life i hope someone much younger will read this i am so fucking tired of living i just want to be 21 so i can fucking blow my brains out i just got kicked out of my own room and i cut myself again after months of being selfharm free i have lost everything and nothing gives me pleasure anymore my mom has told me to kill myself and our relationship is extremely toxic my dads been dead for years and my dog is the only one that gives me some form of love but love is bullshit and not real because it always hurts no matter from who it all keeps tumbling down and i just keep letting me downi seriously do not know what i am going to do when i go back to college with my roommates especially because my classes are still online i w a n t d e a t h i guess just act happy as usual right until i can finally gain the sweet peace i fucking deserve and no longer have to hear these terrible thoughts inside my head earth drives everyone crazy its just a matter of how much you hide your craziness from others because you want to be perceived a certain way fuck this world and everyone in it i quit i felt like an idiot so i just hung up lol the hotline put me on hold for 20 minutes i have lost everything everything and everyone around me the one person that was keeping me alive left me and stopped talking to me i have been played with and people only used me look my mom mental abuses me and talks down on me always arguments between us we just have a horrible relationship i am only 14 and i cannot do anything to help myself i just wish i could be a kid again so i do not have to feel this pain my dad left and he was my everything and i do not have him anymore i have stayed up all night with a hand full of pills wondering what i live for anymore i cannot look at the good things in life anymore i am just so numb to the pain at this point my mom does not care about me and how i feel it does not help my cousin i am close with is severely suicidal and almost went to a mental hospital all i think about is dying i just wish i did not wake up in the mornings i just miss life being easy and not having to worry about anything my family has been homeless for half of my life just living with people i stay in my room all day there is nothing to do when you have zero mental energy to even get out of bed or even eat then one of my closest friends i was living with tried killing me and my mom the police were involved and did actually nothing about it did not even charge him he tried calling me after saying sorry he is a sick person i just want to scream so loud i am just kind of done with living i do not know how people can keep full time jobs i have always had to job hop because i get incredibly overwhelmed and suicidal when i have to work for so long you have no free time to do anything that you enjoy when working because your off days you have to play catch up on chores you missed during the week you do not have the time to go see your loved ones and friends you become so stressed that you lie in bed at night and get absolutely no sleep you have no time to cook a healthy meal because you come home at night and you are so exhausted from the day my anxiety depression panic attacks and suicidal tendencies just start spiraling and i feel like i am drowning i am expected to keep working because everything in life is so expensive why is life so expensive i would love to stay home and tend to my homepets but i cannot afford to not work i feel so stuck i feel like i would much rather commit suicide than continue to suffer this way i would rather die than work for the rest of my life a fucking monster i am evil i have been suicidal for it feels like no reason but there is a reason i do not want to live anymore because of the type of household i live in its toxic and i hate it my parents are split so i only have a mom and step dad i have not seen my biological father in 8 years anyways my household is toxic af when my sisters eating dinner she has to ask to use the bathroom she is 7 she already talks to me about how she hates herself and she calls herself stupid or dumb she is not my actual sister she is my half sister i am a teen and i still have to put my phone up at 8pm everyday i do not want to to sound addicted to my phone but it is the only way i am able to cope since my parents hardly ever let me go outside and at night is usually when i start feeling down or suicidal so i have no one to talk to i have to earn my privacy i have to keep my door open unless it is night or i am changing so i do not get any privacy at all they only approve of one friend and i have known her since i was 3 they get mad at the smallest things and there things they say to me hurt and make me overthink everything my friends and boyfriend love me endlessly and my boyfriend tells me i can talk to him about anything but i cannot talk to him about this or he would end up in tears he is the only reason why i am still here but i still feel like ending everything because i feel a burden to the world i do not know if i am overreacting or not but i just want advice  idk anymore just give advice or help i keep trying to put it away or throw the knife away but it is like an addiction even though i can never bring myself to actually cut how do i stop myself from trying to cut in the shower today is not a very good day and i just want to share it with someone who cares i out of medication and it is very distressing that with just one day without meds can be really bad i have been trying to contact with my doctor but she is not answering i am feeling so alone sometimes i just want someone to asks me hey how are you i write this right here because it really is the only community where i felt like there were cool people and although surely a mod will erase it meh what can i do it was tried and so that if someone who knew me recognizes my story and knows that i triedi am 16 years old and today i may will kill myself because i am already tired of trying\\u200bsince i was little i have never had friends my parents always constantly changed me schools for reasons of the area so i never really had friends never it was just me with my childish antics that is why my parents hated me they hated that i was naughty but i was just a kid and to this day they hate mei even remember a school that i was in my puberty i was desperate for friends but i was not aware that it was the castroso child it seems that even a teacher hated me i remember how one day that teacher stopped her entire class so that the whole class would say the things that bothered him about me it was supposed to be therapy but it was only two hours of all my classmates reminding me of the bad person i am that day i think i left it engraved in my mind because after spending so much time sad i think that i no longer feel my emotions well and i do not know how to socialize very well even though i used to do it well or i thinkwhen i was 14 i moved to mexico because my father found a better job here and well i took my whole family again i started from 0 but i met a girl who for some reason spoke to me and i thought she would i liked it one day i declared myself and i spent several months very happy with her but i kept feeling lonely and confused with so many changes and things and in the end when i asked her for help the only person i had she he ended up pulling away from me again because of mehalf a year ago i did not receive affection from even my family2 weeks ago i did not speak to anyone at allyesterday i decided to write her a letter to free myself knowing that nothing would happen and only take another blow that was already waiting for me alone she told me that even hearing my name makes her bad that i stay away from her maybe if i went bad and if someone is reading this do not wait for logic i think you have already lost a lot of sanity after so many months alone and you know what i am quite tired of fighting if it is me or it is not me the effect is the same if i was bad no one will miss me and everyone will be happy that i am dead and if someone loved me it just does not happen but why did not i see it or did someone ever show it meh i am tired of suffering from shit that is so normal for everyone i am a shitty person and i deserve to be alone for everything i did i do not expect anything anymore i just hide my pain with even more pain with all the cuts in my arm i am tired of everything i have not been a bit of happy months ago my mother loves me and i have lost everything i think that today i will jump from the top floor of my building and see if i am dead and i seem relevant to someone  but you know what nor will it be so you random from the internet who read this i suppose thank you you really must be bored to literally read my last words do not try anything change is no longer an option besides we both know that you care shit it is just a random reddit post you do not have to remind me i just want to erase myself from the face of this earth\\u200bnow i cannot wait more i wrote this a pair of hours ago but i cannot support my own mind anymore i took the full pot of prozac and i am playing cod zombies while listening to it is been a long long time shit too bad i almost took out the zombie dark matter meh someone sure will get my account my last goodbye how much would i have to take to off myself i have a lot of each would it be painful alcohol and ambien i am so stressed and tired i have a lot of homework to do i want to do my own things that make me actually happy i hate having intrusive thoughts because they just torture me i want to sleep all day and no wake up ever i am just a stupid person who even cannot to math what kind of person i ami want to change this life of  every day i want to do something that makes me actually happy i just think that this is the only one life i will ever get why i am spending in things that make me feel like trash why do i let them torture me why do i torture myself why i am not happy i want help like a pysquiatric or something i want to get these demons out of my head i am just the worst and i am want to die really much i do not want this life anymore this got deleted from

reached out to ask if i was okay or tell me they were glad i was still here they are just so  nonchalant about itits basically confirming the fears i have had for years now  that if i actually went through with my urges  committed suicide no one would care i mean their behavior is pretty much proving it my own siblings and parents have not said a word about it just stay safe vanessa that is iti fucking wish it worked tw just survived a suicide attempt and it feels like no one cares i hope you die a horrible painful death as soon as possible to the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned fuck my feelings fuck my thoughts they are not real i am nothing i am just a flesh puppet acting out the will of causality all glory to god mind is not to be trusted i am surrounded by people and yet i feel so lonely i cannot rely on anyone because i am too scared of opening up i just want to get through college but why does no one help why is no one cheering on me i spent a year doing nothing because no one wanted to help me i did everything i could and it still was not enough i even went through things that i never imagine id do just to earn enough money trying to pay for my education and yet i am still labelled as useless by some family members i do not see the point of continuing life anymore i know deep inside me that i still want to live because if i did not i would not be here ranting out i just want one more reason to live please i am so tired i feel so lost i am going to kill myself today by carbon monoxide poisoning but i am not really sure how to do it can someone explain please please help me suicide i have been suicidal for a long time i tried to hang myself in grade 6 and all the way through high school because i was fat but now i think this is it i had an abortion and i feel really guilty and i lied to everyone and told them i had a miscarriage but now it is catching up to me i am facing academic exclusion because i have failed so many classes and i feel like i am going nowhere fast i am poor so i have no choice but to make it and that is a lot of pressure i hate who i have become and i used to feel sympathy for my family that is what would make me not want to do it how they would feel how shattered they would be but now i feel nothing all i say to myself is they will understand and it kind of worries me that i just i am impartial like that i have been crying for hours and i just cannot stop  it feels like something is stuck in my throati hate that i am back in this position because i know i can do better but i do not know how thought i would not but i have been wronged i never asked to be born i have suffered a lot i want revenge my birth was a mistake to those who have attempted how did you get over the fear how do i get over the fear if i could i would kill you all there you go that is how i truly feel i hate humans i give up i have been battling suicide and suicidal thoughts since i was teni used to have something that made me keep on living my dogs my mom my friends this is not the case anymorei know this is selfish but i really do not have the mental strength anymore i cannot find the strength in anybody i feel like my life is a subtle form of agony i will never compare my life to what some people go through and i know i definitely do not have it worse but i cannot explain it its kind of like as if it was a continuous loop or as if you were just chained and could not get out i just want to be free i have waited years for finding the light at end of the tunnel after i said no almost last minute at my firstonly suicidal attempt but i did not i just experienced more bullying more psychological abuse more trauma more hatred for myself eating disorders and body dysmorphia although i have taken some big steps on the last thing and although i am starting to see myself as beautiful i still cannot talk or act normally when i see someone whatever they are a he a she or a them that its beautiful because i feel inferior to them i am afraid of getting insulted in the streets because i am ugly i think ill never be loved as in loved by a boyfriend heck sometimes i even question my gender i am 99 sure its not actual gender dysphoria but rather envy or just the feeling of being someone different at times i do not feel comfortable or part of my friends group i wish i could tell them how i feel but i cannot because i hate being vulnerablei wish i couldyou know but i literally have nothing to do it or at least to not have a painful endprobably still going to prepare in case it happens i am going to give my password to one of my friends so that they can continue to post content on my insta i have not posted since february my followers deserve some damn content i wish i could do it but i do not have anything my grandmother told me you are not the granddaughter i know when i opened up about my abuse and trauma from my parents when i got into an argument with them i also spoke about my depression as well she told me that i should never tell my friends about my abuse or trauma since they will walk away i am glad to have some supportive friends but recently i have been pretty burned out from the constant abusive words i am faced with everyday i have not really talked to anyone since i just have no energy at all maybe i should take my grandmas advice and never ever open up about my abuse and trauma hell maybe i should stop doing to my therapist all together since ill never be able to beat my depression my whole life just continues to spiral down its gotten to the point where i have been contemplating suicide again since i have previously failed years ago i just wish my father swung his wooden chair lower so that he would of bashed open my skull so i would be dead your not the granddaughter i know i just want to diei should be happy but i just want to die it should all end i just want to die i am ready to give up and as the title says nothing seems to help me anymore honestly i have been struggling for so long i do not even know why i have not killed myself already i have no outlet no one to fucking talk to that seems to get it i just want someone not to judge me for once i feel like such a freak for the smallest of things and i do not know how to let it out anymorei feel like i keep making the same mistakes over and over again and yet i have no one to let vent to or let out all this frustration and to truly tell how much of a worthless piece of shit i feel likegod i am so lonely lonely and tired and yet i cannot even get a god damns night rest anymore i wish i was not such a fuckinf coward so i could just do the deed and kill myself already nothing helps me anymore i feel so empty i feel like i am machine i am sick of repeating the same thing every dayyou can easily quit playing games when you got bored of it and i want to quit my life i do not want to live why do i feel so sad i feel so lost and lonely please someone anyone help me either kill me ir save mei want to be saved i want to be comforted i want to make friendsi want to cryi want it all to be overi am too scared to die could some one kill me make me die painlessly pleasehelp me please i am not okay nothing is worth it i try so hard and all for nothing i try my best to be true to me but still i am unwanted i want to die i want to be missed i just want to be wantedbut i am nothing nothing my friends reported me to the school counselors for my thoughtsbehavior expressing that i have been wanting to die they contacted my parents of course and they took away my phone there is a reason why i did not tell them tt what the heck let me go let me go let me golet me go let me go let me go let me go at this moment i am in no danger because i still have fear but i am having daily ideation of the plan down to the last detailas to why the reasons are typical and boring but let us just say i have lived enough and it is getting harder to continue on every day but i still have a lot of resistance to overcome i want to be able to do the deed in a calm detached manner no butterflies no sadness just this is my time to diei have not attempted ever because the way i would do it will be 100 not survivable but there is that pesky selfpreservation instinct to overcome yet mentally preparing myself for the end i really do not want to because its honestly very depressing for me to think that at the young age of 23 i am already considering throwing away my one and only life i wish i believed in some form of reincarnation but i honestly do not i think that if it were possible to somehow trade my life away for another and start all over again i would do it without hesitation but nobody is capable of figuring out what truly lies beyond death and still be around to tell about it is it just an empty void or is it eternal torture what is waiting for me i am scared to find out i honestly do not think ill miss anyone or anything that exists in this world i am having trouble finding new interests to keep me entertained and i am losing the very few that i do i love my parents i would be devastated when the time comes when they are no longer around i honestly do not think i could say the same about any of my siblings any secondary family members or anyone else in general i have become estranged with just about everyone most of them just see me as a lazy bum who does not care to improve himself and maybe they are right but i am also not right in the head so can you really blame me for the way that i feel i feel alonei have ideas on how i could get better but i am just too lazy to do anything about it i think most of this laziness comes from how mentally strenuous some of my ideas are and whether or not it will even be worth it in the end id hate to give myself a bigger headache than what i already have right now all for nothingat this point i find myself romanticizing the act of suicide more and more to finally take charge of your own life and do the inevitable i kind of hope that my life will get progressively worse just so that making the decision to commit suicide will be a lot easier or at least motivate me enough to finally take action into improving myself out of desperation i am at the beginning stages of considering suicide and its making me very uncomfortable please not tonight yes my will is weak i am losing my shit while writing this please save me i am scared one more reason to continue i do not know where else to turn to it feels like my brain hates me i should be happy i have a good job i have a roof over my head and clothes on my back more than a lot of other people have i should be able to smile but it drains more energy out of me than i can possibly describe the voices in my head tell me i am not good enough i will never be good enough pathetic useless worthless stupid waste of space time energy and matter the world would be better without me besides what is a small screw in the grand scheme of things the world will still spin my family will move on maybe without me dragging them down they can finally be happy i look in the mirror and i harbor nothing but disgust and resentment for that thing looking back at me and then it speaks to me pathetic useless i learned at a young age people will pretend to care about you if they can see your scars so i cut my legs they cannot see those no one will ever see those they pretend to care and then talk behind your back oh look cutting again how pathetic grow up be a man i have told my family about the monsters they say its just a phase its not a fucking phase i just want to feel ok ok motherfucker now you have got my attention i need to change a couple things but what to change i eat right i exercise literally only drink water my dog is the only thing in this world keeping me here i made the decision to kill myself june 23rd 2020 at 521 am i tied a noose and hung it in my closet wrote a note that no one would ever care about and stepped into my closet for what i thought was the last time then my dog barked and she never does that i cannot do that to her so i will live for her but how pathetic staying alive for a dog an animal that would forget about me in a month i have family that would forget about me in a month friends that do not even care now i bring up my past to family my parent told me its impossible for a man to get raped well guess i am the impossible happened twice in my life once at 13 and again at 15 so i secluded myself away from women and now i have a hard time opening up to them when trying to get a relationship and they do not understand that not exactly something to bring up on a first date and heh never get second ones how pathetic typing to a bunch of strangers who do not care why should they i have tried getting help but the meds make me feel worse all of them the therapists push their agendas no one is against you they are only for themselves but if i am not for myself then no one is worthless i have even done things that i thought id never do i have prayed and prayed looking asking for help for the strength to get rid of my demons my monsters to no avail the monster just laughs at me useless i used to be smart used to have a lot of practical knowledge now its all superficial stupid nothing i do in this life will make any difference the words i say will bring no impact to anyone else all i want is for just one 1 person to read this i suppose but that is a lot to ask why would they waste their time their energy their precious internet activity on someone so pathetic i want to reach out but i am just a waste of space time energy and matter i do not matter i never will when i die the history books will never say my name they will never look at me just bones in the ground turning to dust at least ill be useful to the fungus probably not even the right place to post this there are so many more people in more need than i am i made a promise and i intend to keep it i will not die until i give my dog the best life its what she deserves does not mean i do not spend every waking moment wishing thinking planning my death one day just disappear never to be seen again i would go to canada in the northern forests find a spot in the summer i have already picked my day june 23rd what a good day to die the method i am not so sure guns are messy pills are unreliable rope does the trick if anyone has read this i thank you i am sorry you have decided to waste your time reading the words of something like me but i thank you nonetheless i have had this typed out for 3 days just hovering over the post button not wanting to burden others with my stupid problems if this gets sent at all id be surprised the monster in the mirror but would you want to face the possibility of finding yourself in a world like this one and go through hell again face your demons here friends to live is to suffer but do not worry death never misses when its your time its your time it might seem long but its not millions of years have passed and trillions of plants animals and humans have already died hell 20 years ago for me seemed like yesterday do whatever feels right for you seriously fuck what society or anyone else thinks do whatever you want except taking the life out of yourself death itself will take care of that for you it always does with 101 accuracy you might think you are already dead inside but are not well all its either that or were numb from pleasure let yourself be a goddamn mess because damn madness is beautiful and we all know we need a littlea lot more crazy in this world you do not want to be here in this hell i tried today partial suspension but i panicked when i started to pass out i do not want to live like this anymore but i am too scared to end things help in less than a month i will kill myself unfortunately i feel only sadness or pain i am just a loser and no matter how many years i live this fact will not change so i decided that it would be easier to finish it all all i hope is that i feel nothing whether during my attempt to commit suicide or after my death i wish i had not been born or lived some happy moments in my life every day is worse than the previous one and unfortunately i am becoming a worse person day by day so i may rest a bit after my death thank you and i wish everyone a happy life i hate myself fuck this life i think i am going to kill myself way to add stress to a stressful situation assholes hey mods stop deleting my posts with no explanation i so desperately want this to be over i despise every last thing about myself i am 30 and i have never experienced any kind romantic or sexual intimacy because i am an ugly gay man and completely inept when it comes to dating i have no experience i have been so poor that i cannot feed myself my career as a professional musician has gone down the tubes because of the pandemic and i am stuck with a new job that gives me intense anxiety and amplifies my selfhatred nobody in my life has any idea it has gotten this bad and i do not want to reach out to friends or family because i am sick of the wellintentioned responses that make me feel to blame or worse about myselfwhile i do blame myself for quite a lot i do not blame myself for wanting to die this world really fucking sucks i have no hope for society in general  latestage capitalism and climate change are the terminal cancer of humanity and i am sure that it is people like me that are going to suffer the worst deathsi cannot say i have not tried to get better i have had aloof unsympathetic therapists over the years who have prescribed me medicine i end up not being able to afford but i still tried yesterday i called down a list 20 therapists covered by my insurance the other day to see if they were accepting new patients and not one of them called me back i guess i just really do not believe anyone is really equipped capable or willing to help me out of thisthe obstacles keeping me from killing myself are insurmountable like knowing the effect it would have on my family my cat and the lack of a risklesspainless method so for now i guess i am just stuck in this unbearable existence being able to kill myself is just as ludicrous of a goal as me finding any level of real or sustainable happiness i do not know what to do with that other than writhe in agony until my natural time comes hell is real and i am here the definition of hell i cried for the first time in years the summer class i depended on told me i was not eligible and i could not follow the course anymore after two weeks of learning i enjoyed my school functions on a modular system which is extremely flawed towards students with undiagnosed adhd and little autonomy i love learning but my school does not have teachers we have modules 60130 pages of selflearning this system where students advance at their own pace is a nightmare for people with un medicated adhd like me in part to why i loved my summer class so much was because the teacher would talk to you and guide you through the subject i wish i had changed schools earlier in my highschool career its too late for all that being a maximum one year behind was my goal and i would have reached it if i had finished 8th grade science when i was 14 in 9th grade they removed my science and social studies subjects to focus on the more important ones same for 10th grade why would they do this if you need them to graduate i have planned suicide this whole year delaying it with the thought that if i finish this summer class i will only have to do two years in one my second option now gone i have never been closer to sneaking out and jumping off an abandoned parking lot nearby i have hit a dead end i will not graduate and i will not go to college i will be 16 doing 8th grade science putting me 3 years behind i had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself i must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night thankfully i did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time my wife and i drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me i cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when i bring up a desire to stop we often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good i hate myself so much for what i have become and yet i cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself instead just wishing it changes on its own even killing myself i often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something how awful is that i am so lazy and lately i cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore we have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and i hate the idea of her not knowing her father at the same time i hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum maybe if i kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent at the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so i do not feel as bad i keep wishing i was a better person and yet never taking any action i am the only one that can make a change it does not just happen but i am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop i am just looking to get this off of my chest  please disregard my dream is to live on a farm maybe not a whole farm but i want a cute little cottage big enough for two cats a dog or two some chickens and a garden to live in a small town preferably where family values are still alive id love to have someone to love and cherish and wed have a kid or two one day my husband would be really nice to me and not make fun of me or compare me to other girls and make me feel like a failure for being born i want to be known as that cute polite mysterious farm girl instead of a depressed anxious orphan to finally have someone i can tell my story to and they would hug me and comfort me and tell me its going to be okay instead of just saying that is rough id love to have a small job on the side and spend the rest at home taking care of the household i do not hold much value to myself anymore i only continue to live for other peoples sake anyway that is my dream maybe one day ill get to it i am not so hopeful though the life i dream of i know i am an attention whore no one cares about me here every little thing shows me no one needs me not my teammates from the game i play and suddenly i am stupid at not my parents i wish someone would miss me after we fought or after not talking for months i want to feel needed i wish someone would need me fcking demons they call me lazy while i am here holding myself not to kill myself i am staying in my small town i am to stupid to live in a big city il have a job here  disability i do not care anymore i must except my fate at this point i was born with the wrong genes it was meant to be like this i am moving to online school i think after i am done with school il have litterly no way of making friends i know no one care i am thinking about trying again in 5 days or so uni is going to come back during covid so i have until then to die i am thinking of a bunch of stuff i want to do before then it looks like i have put out suicide for now i tried but i only managed to go through with half my plan have the rope and chair ready i will wait until the early am of next day if anyone wants to ask about something or discuss something other than that it is a goodbye here we are trigger warning i was violently raped in 2015 and i still have flashbacks this is one factor in my decision to commit suicide i am in therapy but i just do not think i can get over it and i think this is why i cannot make friends because it was basically date rape and the fact that it was date rape fucks me up too it feels like it was less of a rape because the judge claims that because i willingly went to the guys house after meeting him twice at restaurants that it was not considered rape i am just feeling especially bad today  kill myself because of being raped i am so done with being assaulted lied to raped robbed etc then i have no reputation i love other people but they hurt menobody ever really loves me fuck it i hate life o really do whatever i try i every time end up doing the wrong thingi want to end my life i have thoughts of this every single day but i am a chicken and i am afraid of physical paini am sure i will end up having cancer like my father in his last year of life while he also wanted to jump out of the window in the hospital and all my fathers family side gave the fault on me 2 years latery my grandfather had the same fate it is been 6 years since then i was just a stupid 17 years old guy my entire school life was a nightmare bullying and no real friends for 7 years i have been suffering from nightmares that are recurring every single day i have engaged on a relationship when i was 19 and i got sexually harassed and forced into sex i then realized that i liked guys more and been in a relationship for 5 month with a guy i met online and left me after me having a couple of breakdown all of my projects failed and i now have no money to help my family and i have broke every single friendship that i had so farthe funny thing this is only a sumive tried i really did with my psychiatrist but every single event in my horrible life ended up being a disaster i have no hope for the future other than dying in my sleepi do not know what to do anymore i will gladly gave my years left in this world to whoever wants iti am exhausted it is all my fault i feel like my subconscious is planning my murder and there is nothing i can do about it i know its mind over matter and i am suppose to be stronger than this i am suppose to fight it but i truly feel like i cannot do it anymore ill be home alone all day on friday and i hope i just sleep all day because the thought of anything else scares me so much right now friday i held a cocked 410 shotgun to my head i was scared of the pain so i un cocked it and unloaded it last night i almost took my own life my therapist convinced me to get rid of my last one a couple months ago fool me once but not again its going to be a relief to have my rope again for when the time seems appropriate to follow through with my plan rewriting my notes again soon too made sure they are genuine heartfelt and apologetic in my drafts ordered another rope hi everyonerecently i have been feeling really bad again i am trying to keep going but its so hard i have this strange feeling i just feel really low and anxious all the time i feel awful and i cannot stop thinking about all sorts of bad things that upset me or scare me i do not know what i am supposed to do id probably drink but i have run out of alcohol and i do not want to leave home to get more i do not know what to say to people about it without just worrying them i just need to do something to say something i need to make this stop but i do not know what to do not doing good hey guys i am new here so i really do not know what i should talk about i am 19 years old and i am suicidal every night i try to kill myself but end up failing badly that which frustrates me yesterday was the day that it finally dawned upon me that i wanted to end it all i have never had anyone to get me through this except for myself and my bipolar disorder not even my family try or reach out to me so i am hoping to get good advice here on reddit well mainly because it is my dad causing these suicidal tendencies i cannot even do the things i love anymore i cannot even enjoy one of my games properly because of these thoughts of feeling utterly useless i hope this reaches out the people that can help me because i truly am suffering 19 years old suicidal there is something i need to get off of my chestto be honest i am impressed and with all do respect i contest that i am not depressedi have never been impressed when writing thingsand possessed to inevitably suppress all the addressed that is molested my headallowing me to feel just a little more deadinside i climb to try and reach my mindthe sublime chime of a cheap rhyme ill apply and provide to my aching and breaking blind mindin an attempt to cover up the painbut it never works it sticks to me like my nameit feels like i can never get awayi am tired of being here its been establishedits crystal clear that there is an imbalance taking place right in between my earsbut it feels so much more so much unexploredis it wrong to hope tomorrow ill not wake up left to explore the whore that is death on my cold concrete floor unhappy unsatisfied and completely dead inside if someone were to stab me or if got hit by a truck right now ill thank that person for saving me to this despair i am planning to stab myself soon i cannot see any future for myself anymore i cannot bear to live another day these thoughts is drowning me every single day i cannot do this anymore i plan to die around the end of november i know what date i am going to do it and i have some ideas on how i am going to die i chose november because my big important essay is due and i do not want to waste my effort from writing the first and second drafts another reason is because i was suppose to die on the same day a few years ago but i had to go somewherei have been feeling like shit for years especially this summer my old therapist  last meeting was 3 years ago 9th grade first suicide attempt  gave me meds that did not even work  50mg and only 8 tablets and its fucking expensive  and his last advice was to have fun yeah thanks a lot i have been coping in a really bad way but i do not know if i am ready to give it upschoolwise i am doing fine but my parents are hellbent on making me go to college in my home country  because the school gave me the wrong term 3 results  and i do not want to go there because of its conservative laws and i have views that can get me killed or shunned a shit ton of victimblaming and overall i just want to go far away from my parents because they treat me like i am 5 my mom insists that i stay at home and go to onlineschool when i am in college and it made everything worse i said to myself i would rather kill myself than be with them i do not know what major i want to be in i just want to move out i do not know why but this subreddit makes me feel safe for telling all of this i do not know where to get better advice i lost my reason to live i do not know what to doi will do an update if i am alive by then i want to end it all just do it nobody will care nobody does care i do not matter not good enough just stop i do not deserve lovethese thoughts go through my mind constantly every day i hear them nonstop always hearing that i am no good and i am not good enough its true i do not have any value in this world someone once commented something along the lines of everyone deserves love and kindness to which i have a question if everyone deserves love and kindness then why have not i gotten any if everyone in this world deserves it then why am i alone right now with no one unlike everyone i do not deserve love and kindness instead i should be hurt and used and insulted and criticized that is what i have been my whole life abandoned left behind forgotten blocked that is what i know best thoughts sometimes i feel like i may be able to help others and really demonstrate support and care but i just cannot get the words or ideas to say it all can do is read you pals and gals knowing that you are probably much younger than me when i did not know of this sub existence that has helped me a lot through very nasty momentsi am sorry i really am i wish i could come on here and say something useful this is kind of just ganna be a thought dump i guess but its something i need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my headi do not really understand myself anymore i have not in a really long time i do not even remember a time where i could accurately describe how i am feeling there are times when i am with friends or by myself and i do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and i like that i have heard people say i keep myself busy i do not give myself the time to be sad but its just more complicated than that it is not just sadness its anger selfhate and a strange emptiness i cannot describe even when i am out with people speaking with them even when i am distracting myself with some type of work there is just this sense of hollownessi used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out one way or another they had to right they do until they just do not anymore nothing works the same and realistically i know that is because of me there are moments just the briefest instants of motivation i have to force things to work out to really put shit in place and buck the fuck up ya know and then it just disappears and i am just at such a loss i do not remember when i first thought it but sometimes things just do not work out i realized something was not right a few years ago i have thought about death since middle school really considered it hard but i would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then up until i was 20 i figured i did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl besides what did i have to complain about there are people that are much worse off i was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down i had this little postit note that i wrote a ton of things on they were basically ways that i would off myself if i ever had the chance to it was meant to be kind of like an angry letter you write it and then throw it away some closure or dumb shit like that well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk she was kind of a hard ass the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing but there were times where she was really nice that was one of those times anyway i told her that there was nothing to worry about i was just in a mood she did not tell anyone thank fucking god but its where i learned that thinking like that was not actually normal i do not work there anymore i quit not long after that it was just too strange for me i felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that i wonder if she would show up to my funeral there is honestly a lot more i would like to share but i do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so i will wrap it up i want to see a doctor i need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive i want medication but i cannot get it i do not want to feel like this anymore i do not want to look up how i can die painlessly anymore i do not want to debate how much longer i want to give myself anymore i wish i lived in sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia that is not as scary as a gun and a rope i want to fix my braini am sorry i know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same but i needed to put it somewhere i needed to exist beyond my house i am not posting this for sympathy or pity just for me and me alone the same way people carve their names in trees although this is much longer than a name my brain its been about 36 hours since i eat or drank anything i am not really hungry or particular thirsty with a slight abdominal pain i think ill pay my rent and go to sleep soon so nobody bothers me i think i found a peaceful way to die i was born with meth in my systemmy mom was going to abort me but my stepdad decided to intervenemy biological dad that i have never met was a depressive loser with a little dick and i inherited everything from him but his tallnessi grew up homeless essentiallywe got to stay at my great grandmas house alotbut the majority of my childhood was spent in my step dads chevy k5 blazerthroughout my life i always movedwhenever i would make friends and gain a connectionwe would leaveit left me numb and unable to form relationships with the abject poverty and constant drinkingpartyingdomestic violence every night and a mom that never hid anything from me i had to grow up quickly by 10 years old i had already told myself that i was ready to die not that i wanted tobut i was readythis made me really unrelatable to my peersi acted like a little old man and never got to experience a normal childhoodby my highschool years everybody thought i was a crackhead because i was always nervousmy clothes were dirtyand i never had good shoes this led to me accepting that i was a lonerbut i am full of social desireall this made me really cold and unfeeling on the outsidei am really bad at expressing my emotions and anytime someone is fighting or in an argument i revert to the same frozen state of my childhoodfast forward to nowi am 20 years old and i am the only source of income in my familymy stepdad has been in prison for 3 years on a 15 year bid my mom has alot of health problems but even so she refuses to work or get disabilityher constant drinking worries memy 16 year old sister lost her mentor when her dad went awaythese last few years she has been following my moms moldsmoking cigarettesdropping out of schooldoing nothingi work 48 hours a week and when i come home i am 100 occupied by serving others i have no future no personality no ambition i do not even have my license yeti am just spinning in circles going through a deep cycle of depression and coping mechanismsi am fat and shorthave an odd shaped body and just generally ugly i have no redeeming qualities physicallyi cannot stand to look at myself in the mirroror work up the courage to find a gf and be lovedbut i get awkward around girls i like and make things weirdi have no purposeno place on this earth i bought really sharp knives on amazon but i do not want to be in pain and reflect on my life as i lie bleeding outi am waiting to get a gun so i can just do a quick shot to the head and get i over withno more bad thoughtsno more missing the countless friends i have left behind in the 30 schools i went to as a kidno more pain no more me sorrydo not mean to give my life storybut i think it is relevant to why i do not want to breathe i have let fear and insecurity lead my entire 20s here is is what happens after 10 yearsi did not think about what i wanted to do because thinking about myself and the future was terrifying i could have pushed myself trough that discomfort but did not i ended up doing two majors i cannot get a job with or even like to do i told myself i would but deep inside it was not for me i have adhd and generalized anxiety disorderi did not make many friends because of my crippling self hatred and insecurity i preferred to be aloneyeah i hushed that fear by thinking everything would come to me by itself i was raised a very lucky kid i think that is why i thought it would all be ok like everything up until like 25we had a beautiful house in a very nice neighborhood a second house could practice anything we wanted never had to worry etc i would say my parents are kind of elitist i had all the opportunities in the worldnow i stand on my own legs and can barely pay for anything next to that i have lost the things you lose at 29 the excitement parties friends something to look forward to part of my looks i literally have nothing that gives me joyi am so lonely i am so regretful the dead end this is just a rant while my highs are not high my lows and very very low and its creeping back in i am unable to comprehend how random and chaotic my mind is right now and the only way out is the easy one how can i be the bad guy how can she hate me more that her abuser and her molesterwhat burns me the most is that hes gotten away with it now hes happy with a new born i am sure she is forgiven him but i know she will never stop hating me because my existence is a reminder of the guilt and betrayal she inflicted on me every time she thinks about me she cannot accept the fact that what she did was wrong but people will defend her she was manipulated and abused i know her well well enough to know that even now when she touches her self she thinks about him the memories they had how good it felt the rush and excitement and deep down she does not regret it i cannot stand the fact that in her story the one who loved her i am the bad guy its creeping back again and the only answer is me leaving this crazy world there is a million different reasons why i am autistic i was bullied throughout my school years and emotionally abused by my parents at home i have never had any friends and i was kicked out of school a few months ago i do not even know what is going on anymore and i am scared i feel like i might kill myself in the next few weeks i am asexual which means i have no sex drive and feel no sexual attraction and i will never have a romantic relationships because of it i have schizophrenia dissociation depression i have had a horribly traumatic brain infection which gave me ptsd i had a benzodiazepine overdose which probably gave me a brain injury do not know if it did i have been postponing the mri i have an abusive father who used to beat me i was bullied and excluded in both primary school and high school i have 1 true friend yet my relative said about me that i am the most kind person she is ever met i do not deserve this crap there are probably some more shitty things i forgot to list because well brain injury wow my life sucks i am 18 i cannot even bear a thought to even live anymore everything has been taken away from me when i was small i was sexually abused by my cousins multiple times i have told my parents but they shut me by saying that i am lying i am still confused about how a 4yearold child will lie i was abused till the age of 10 till now i stutter to talk to older men then i work way up in my studies even got declared as a good student in my district at the age of 11 but i manage to get only 6a 1b in my upsr upsr is a malaysianbased examination for students at the age of 12 i did not lose hope and studied hard in class teachers used to praise me being a smart student but only to get lower marks in exams i do not know what is wrong with me and my examinations then pt3 happen and i got 6a 4b i got into science streams 2019 was the worst year for me would be an understatement i was accused of cheating stealing stuff by a teacher i was removed as the head prefect of my school and president of the red crescent society of my school i was falling into depression i started to skip classes thoughts of hurting myself have always been in my mind at the end of 2019 all the accusations thrown at me were proven wrong but people still treated me like i am some kind of a bad person i just want everything to end but my friends always stop me so in my last year of high school i studied hard despite the pandemic i worked my ass off my friends were worried about me i just wanted to get out of my house and pursue my dream job i wanted to become a doctor in the spm examination i got 7a 3b and 2c  the sijil pelajaran malaysia or the malaysian certificate of education is a national examination taken by all fifthform secondary school students in malaysia  i was exictied and thrilled except for my parents who were angry that i got 3b and 2c well i applied for matriculation in my country unfortunately i did not get in bcuz my country has this quota system where only 90  of bumiputera  bumiputra is a malaysian term to describe the malay race and other indigenous peoples of southeast asia and used particularly in malaysia  while only 10 of nonbumi are allowed despite being a citizen of malaysia i was very disapointed i wanted to pursue a levels but my family denied so i went for the second best option stpm  stpm is a preuniversity examination in malaysia  i got in science stream and i was happy i later found out my parents have changed my stream to arts as they want me to become a lawyer i wanted to become a doctor when i ask the school administrators for advice they told me i cannot do anything nothing can be changed i feel numb i feel the world has stopped i feel nothing is meaningful anymore i feel my life has ended i wanted to end all of this paain i cannot bare anymore i do not want my friends to feel guilty that its their fault i just want to dissapear i cannot handdle this pain and toture i just want to pursue my dream but there is no other way i feel i am going to hurt myself i do not know what to do i feel the world has stopped and i just want to dissapear i need to be dead but i cannot bring myself to commit suicide but i made a plan a week ago and at first i wanted to wait untill my sister leaves for uni but i do not think ill be able to make it for this long i honestly never thought it would come to this i said i wanted to be dead i prayed to die countless of times but always thought i am too much of a wuss to actually kill myself i am not so sure anymore i cannot keep up a job i started working now after almost a year of sitting at home but i am already breaking down and had panic attack before and at work i am living with my father even though i will be 21 soon i do not even know what to say and how to explain myself to others anymore i have no future no plans no nothing all my energy goes into trying to survive into getting through the day into not killing myself i cannot deal with people i have severe social anxiety no one understands me and i cannot do therapy because i just go mute everytime i am terrified of going to the doctors i am not even registered with a gp i am not from the uk i have taken fluoxetine lamotrigine when i was still in school likely as a misuderstandimg because i would not say anything and i would miss my appointments because my mother would not take me there and sertraline last year privately through online appointments because i am incapable of going to a real doctors office and none od them worked they made me feel nauseous and gave me headaches i also went through an episode of unexplained joint and bone pains that made me lay on bed and cry from the pain i have trouble sleeping i had times where i did not eat much and now i am overeating and bingeing cannot get myself to cook real food or clean i got fat and hate myself i cannot stand it anymore i am tired and want it to finally end it is such a horrible feeling because i know how i will die i know i will kill myself it is just a matter of time i just do not know when exactly it will happen its hard but i know i really do not have much time left because living is just unbearable i do not know why i wrote this but i guess it is good to get it off my chest or smth just a rant ok i know this is a hot button topic but i was screwed when i was 1213 and have had to register as a sex offender since then i am 38 now original conviction happened out of state and if i were in that state i would not have to register anymorei know its a hot button issue but if there is any criminal attorney that would be willing to provide me with advice id greatly appreciate it clearly i am poor as hell  otherwise id hire someone to deal with thisand please do not judge me i was 1213 when i signed the confession because the officers said i would never see my family again if i did not and when the court finalized it i was 15 then a few years ago i was raped for the third time and from that experience ended up with hiv i just do not think i have the strength anymore after dating a heroin addict getting him help and watching him relapse  is that all i am good for to be used and abused by everyone my step sister her friend the courts every guy i have dated i am fuck it in my 30s and almost done severe content warning for mentions of eating disorders and emotional abusei have had binge eating disorder for as long as i can remember ever since i was a child i would eat large amounts of food to cope with stress as i have been in an abusive household my whole life i have always known this was a problem and i have tried to lose weight but my eating habits feel uncontrollable they have caused many problems and in 2019 i was diagnosed with morbid obesityi knew my problems were getting more grave than ever and my parents rather than trying to help in any way have scolded me yelled at me and denied it being related to my mental health and even denied that i had any mental health problemsit was not until late 2020 where they started taking my mental health even remotely seriously as i had a severe depressive episode that resulted in me not eating i then got a professional counselor and i was diagnosed with depression general anxiety and ptsd i was prescribed prozacfluoxetine to help with this even after getting therapy and professional help my eating habits have not changed fluoexetine has also helped me gain more weightrecently i have been struggling to breathe whenever i realized that my health has gotten this bad i started bawling i started to feel like my days are limited and that i am going to die before i could turn things aroundtruly i do not want to die i have many friends i care for dearly and i want to at least live somewhat of a life for myself and escape my abusive home however i do not know if i will be able to make things better for myself and i looked up the costs of oxygen in which costs more a day than my family makes per month making me feel like i have no other options than to die slowly and painfully or by my own hands tldr i have had horrible eating habits since childhood that my abusive family has refused to get me help for it for a long time that have gotten so bad that they have resulted in breathing problems and i cannot afford medical help so i feel as if all i can do is die slowly or end my own life myself i feel like i am dying slowly have any of you guys cut before cutting tldr having chest pain due to insomnia so who knows what will happen ngl  i am tired  i am tired of the waking hell i am in  i am tired of feeling pain  the constant reminder of not being lovable being sexy or being good enough people tell me to love myself how can i love when i do not even know who i am i have been abused and used for decades iwas born into this world a mistake not made to do anythingbut i fukin thought

to classes even tho they need an adult to first sign ya up back when i was 16 all my dreams  my happiness my little space  everything is gone i grab what little is there as is and still i feel nothing as i lay awake with pain near my chest and inner thoughts swarming my mind  idk what will happen to me  but honestly i am not ready  i had a mission but i was stopped every time and i cannot keep up the fight  i am sorry little brothers i tried for you  so you would not deal with their abusive toxic ness honestly as i write now i will fight to stay up so i can help you  but all i know is that i am proud of you mom you have begun to change  very slowly but i hope i can watch things change as well  because our family name has been muddy so much  bickering and fighting has wreaked our name though out the generation i wanted to fight on and try to fix it  but its a long process family if you do find this i am sorry  i tried  but i guess being cleaned just was not enough  i hope i can fight on lord  i want to see my 60 to 70s no matter what my depression has made me say  so i can let my brother live his best life i will not take my life ill fight till someone else does  i guess i am thinking more financially like will mortgage payment protectionlife insurance go up what is the repercussions of a failed attempt i just cannot anymore i am getting really close to ending it all my parents are going away in a few days and once i am alone then that be the time i say goodbye to this world i am going to say goodbye to everyone very soon what should i do when i feel so down so useless and so uneeded i feel like no one would miss me when i die because i am irrelevant i want to be stabbed to death like everyone in fear street fear street i know exactly the day i am going to do it there are several reasons why i have chosen this date first my best friend of 12 years is getting married and i will be his best man in november second i want to see my family for christmas one last time i am going to drive myself somewhere relatively far and shoot myself in the head while in my car i carry the suicide note i have already written in my wallet i break down and cry every day i think about dying almost every minute of the day i do not sleep well i will not eat for days at a time i have lost all motivation and hope for the future i am 24 years old and i have no desire to continue to live i am only afraid that i will end my life before this date i have spoken with suicide hotline several times this month only to keep myself alive until the end of december i think about my plan everyday and its the only kind of mental relief i feel i hope to die leaving my loved ones with good memories of me its hard to fake being okay i am only staying alive for them unfortunately they are not enough to keep me going i am certain i will end my life i am going to end my life in december that is normal not i have always hated myself and my life so much ever since i was a kid suicidal thoughts ever since i was a kid it just gets worse the more i age i am quite broken my mind tormented and plagued by past trauma and existential crises it is so appealing to escape the suffering of life and the suffering of my mind i was planning to travel to some places i really wanted to see before i die like the pyramids and the great wall of china but now i am wondering why bother i feel a bit like a coward in not wanting to go through with a painful suicide method like hanging i just want to leave this world peacefully i am not sure which method yet some kind of gas probably that is always been one of the main ones i have been interested in but there is still quite a bit of preparation you need to do for this method like obtaining the gas and then setting up the method whether an exit bag or something exit bag sounded good but looking at people in them it seems a bit morbid now like your last moments of vision will be in a bag i am not sure i am researching about suicide methods on my birthday i think i am asexual unfortunately i just want to be like everyone else i want normal feelings i hate myself for this i want to kms i hate this i want to be normal why am i like this what is some hardcore drugs i can take what can i overdose on my mum is an amazing person  i love her i am an only child 15  if i was to end my life it would devastate her to the point of suicide aswelli have thoughts about wishing my mum was dead so then i could commit suicide without feeling guilt sometimes i even think about committing murdersuicideafterwards i always punch myself for thinking about such pathetic ideas  i hate myself for thinking about devastating a 53 year old woman who just wants to see her kid grow up am i a cunt for wanting my mum dead i feel better now at least if i get the courage people will get an explanation i wrote my note it is really hard thinking of anything i would rather be than non existent i am not the type to seek help but i am empty i am broken i am alone i am broken i really want to be dead i am so fucking tired i have gotten diagnosed with bpd a few months ago and its made how i feel and why i feel that way a lot clearer to me but it does not make me want to end it any less i have been failing in life and loosing all of my friends and i just cannot take it anymore i really want to fucking kill myself i am so tired thinking of ending it i have heard too many stories about people being on hold for a minute or for hours tbfh you guys have helped me more than the suicide hotline i am aware that samaritans will call an ambulance if they believe i am in danger but can they call one if i do not give them my location or any details ect like can they get the police to track my phone signal can calling samaritan get me sectioned even if i do not tell them my location i am a minor with a mom who is fatphobic i am being constantly told every couple of fucking hours how my thighs are too big always told that i look like i gave birth to 9 children she constantly compares our arms and saying mine was bigger than hers that i have too many stretch marks she always tells me that when i am an adult i would thank her for all that she is saying and i would regret my body so much she just told me i was gaining a flabby big lower belly and i should immediately exercise my dad is a bit better but i think that is only because we do not talk much only a couple of times a week and 50 of our conversation is just him reminding me of how fat i am and how i would die of obesity my sister tells me to just lose weight as if i do not want to already she is been skinny her whole life even when she eats even more than i do it just feels like she is mocking mei want to work on myself and i really do want to change but i just want to lose weight when i am happy when i can love myself for who i am where i do not need to wait for midnight to cry and vent mental breakdowns every night just so they cannot hear me when i do not get anxiety every time i try to dress up because i feel like a whale trying to fit in barbie clothesi am not even obese i am just 10kg over the normal weight range for my age and i feel like i can lose this weight when i try to but i am just not in the right mindset right now i cannot try and force myself to exercise without my self loathing getting even more intense when i see myself i hope that people who says losing weight is easy if you just put your mind to it sees this i know i am fat i know i need to lose weight i know myself and my body more than you do i deal with more than just my weight it comes with extreme self loathing anxiety and even depression the mental burden we deal with cannot be easily cured by losing weight so i do not need the constant reminder of how ugly and unhealthy my body looks because it just adds on to my existing selfhate family is the main reason i want to kms only thing holding me back is the debt i would leave my family just want to pay that off and leave them with as much as i can so i do not leave any sort or burden at least any more than i already will just need to take care of one thing before i completely turn the light off it is been 3 days since i have been planning to cut myself and lose a ton of blood til death but i always think of the expenses my family will spend just because of ending my life  idk it is so hard to sleep every night with bombarded thoughts i am already 21 and how come i still do not know how my future going to be stopped college for 2 years been waking up doing the same shit routine like eat wash dishes sleep then eat again applied jobs that will not accept me looked for sponsors for my college unfortunately i lack requirements applied scholarship for axie for about a month already idk it is so hard to see my fellow schoolmates are progressing then here is me doing fucking nothing my life is more deserving to those who die i am just wasting my life i am so donei hope you could send help to my fam if i already end my life tonight it sucks to know that it is expensive to die i do not think anyone or anything can stop me i no longer have any reason to live even my future is certain i am really depressed my grades are declining and not a single person enjoys being around me or having anything to do with me i am currently planning what the most painless way will be any suggestions and do not try to say do not kill yourself there is help out there i have seeker help and it did not work at all i am miserable and just want to end this shit what would the least painful way be i have decided to kill myself sitting in the darkness with a knife in hand held to my chest waiting for either sleep or depression to win another one of those nights covid gave me a nice break from uni for a while it was nice since my mom passed away recently and i wanted to process but the thought of going back now makes me think about killing myself i have some really good friends from high school but everyone at uni is so awful and i hate everyone there and they make it so hard to exist and god i do not want to work with any of them i just want to dieand then just the thought of actually doing work again sounds awful i feel so useless but i just cannot understand this course properly and it is all messed up because of covidthis year has been awful and i do not know if i will ever be able to get paid work because i am so dumbi am just sitting on the couch thinking about how i should die i get overwhelmed by the dumbest things it is 120 in the morning here and i cannot sleep can somebody please talk to me is anybody here i honestly do not knowi do not know if contemplating suicide as an option relentlessly makes me suicidal or noti do not know what would happen if i committed suicidewhat i do know is that i want to commit suicide because damn life is hard soaking up everyone elses emotions is hard feeling like you are too young to die is hardlosing those that you have called friends is hard cutting contact is hard being called indecisive and unable to say goodbye and move on is hard being ignored is hard being in a relationship romantic or otherwise is hardi have had really bad experiences in the past one of who i thought were my closest buddies gaslighted me for years i was always bullied and ignored i have recently moved to another school and things have been easier but i am afraid to trust anyone so i have been pushing people away because the easier it is to convince myself that i am not their friend makes it easier when i mess up and the relationship burns down and i have dropped hints everywhere that i want support but nobody ever noticed even going to a therapist is hard because i do not trust the therapist enough to tell her anything about how i am feeling because that information invariably ends up in my parents hand and i do not trust my parents with a single atom in my body because some part of teenage me does not trust adults because i do not want anyone to worry about me because in the end this is my burden to carryso yeah i have been contemplating suicide i have even written a draft of a letter to share with certain people i have once felt even remotely close to trusting i have been getting no sleep at all lately i have researched the afterlife to try and see what it may be like after i die so what nowi guess there are two options to do it or not tothat is all i wanted to share thanks for bearing with me when trust issues meet suicidal thoughts so i have been diagnosed with panic disorder severe depression and i also have horrible anger issues that just make me feel like shit afterwards for a few years now my depression and anger have taken a bad fucking turn it is gotten so bad that i have been pounding brick walls and getting into fights as a form of self harmpunishment stupid i know but it also keeps the anger in checkabout four months ago i stopped taking my meds i mean they barely helped me anyway no one really knows what is been going on with me and i think that is for the best i am about to start college in about a month and i am extremely tempted to kill myself before thendays just blure together and the faces of friends start to lose their meaning i honestly feel like i am out of options at this point and i do not know what to do i wish the best for everyone that reads this but i do not believe that anything good is in the cards for me my only constant emotions are rage and utter sadness and no amount of support can change that i am so lonely and i am alone since i was a childits so hard to go on i am so lonely something i like to do when i feel like giving up is think about my future and how in a few months i will not be upset and down about the things that are making me feel like this right now and think about how in a few years you will most likely be happy 3 i hope everyone has a better year than the previous one and things get better but it might take a while it is better to wait then to give up p a tip to use when you feel like giving up3 i do not know what happen this month i look at my hands after dealing with eczema for ducking years and seeing all the marks and wrinkles it left and all the names i was called makes me want to cry to sleep i cannot stop thinking about it it will never go way i tried everything it will never go away i told people to focus on there skin cuz maybe if i cared about my skin instead of school i would be still here importance of self care do not be like me yep my life is so meaningless my friends family are better without me i want to be ruby lane i want to slit my wrists like ruby lane from fear street again i really do not want to seem like an asshole because i know some people are just trying to help but its incredibly frustrating to me and i often feel patronized in spite of myself i know the majority of these people do it to come off as an objectively good person and care little for people who are actually suffering in this way i hope this does not come off as overly pessimistic but i really cannot stand shirts or whatever that say you matter or you are loved i currently live in the yous with my mother and my partner is from poland i would like to move in with them but it is a huge step that has given me a lot of anxiety i think its time for me to commit to the decision or else i will end my lifei currently live with my mother she is quite abusive in a few ways and she constantly controls my life i am a gamer so of course i love to game and i can spend a lot of time on that my anxiety and depression is preventing me from being able to continue college i had to drop out after one semester due to it causing me to attempt suicide i still do not feel ready to go back i am 19 and due to the fact that i live under my mothers roof its unfortunately her house and her rules i do not know if she means well the majority of the time she says she wants the best for me and wants me to be something in life but just because i am not going to college right now does not mean i will never go i am just not ready she constantly takes her anger out on me and never apologizes i often feel uncomfortable living with her and stay locked alone in my room she gets upset if i sleep in late but that is my choice because i am not feeling well i often stay up late and sleep in late why should it matter to hermy experience with therapy has been awful it took me contacting 10 therapists to even get one response during therapy i have just been judged and my issues compared with others and it has never helped i had one psychiatrist tell me to just stop gaming completely when i use it to cope with how shit life is my psychiatrist told me yesterday that my partner will leave me for being useless and not having a job she also told me that if my mother were to die id be taken advantage of and used in the system it feels so fucked up that she would say those things to me all i could do was cry if i am being honest i wanted to shout fuck you and punch her but i somehow had restraint not to do thati am 19 i have a lot left to life and honestly i fucking hope i do not but ill just say that because of reality and just because i do not have a job nor am attending college now does not mean i am worthless i do not understand why my life has to be controlled and i have to be forced to do things i am not ready for college makes me suicidal and so does my mother i feel like its time to move outthe reason i am coming here to post about this is because is it really the right choice i know there will be yes and nos but i want to hear what others opinions are i have been with my partner for just over 2 years and i have been thinking about this major decision for over a year it gives me quite a bit of anxiety i have never been to poland but we have met twice would have been more if it were not due to the pandemic i do not have anywhere else to go my family is toxic as hell and none of my friends really have space for me to be there i also will not be able to bring my cats with me if i choose to go it will be a huge lifestyle change too my partner has constantly reassured me that they will take care of me and i will have time to improve my mental health before i start making any big steps into the work force or college honestly i feel like id feel more comfortable doing things if i was there with them because i love them and i am comfortable with them i just do not know if making a drastic change to a different country will be worth it in the long run i do want to move away from my mother but its so far and its so different i do not want to judge i just hope that i will be happy if i make that choice even though i know it will be a lot of stress and anxiety i am hoping that it will improve my mental health in the long run and allow me to actually be able to control my life and be able to breathe maybe ill actually find a competent therapist and psychiatrist there that are not pieces of shiti am writing this calm as fuck right now but in reality my brain is spinning i do not want to go back to my pieceofshit psychiatrist in a week if i cannot move out i genuinely will kill myself and i feel like moving is the better choice because knowing me id fail and turn into a vegetable  i genuinely do want to die all the time but i feel like if i can actually enjoy life it would be worthwhile staying at the same time i want to make the right choice i can move out but if i do not ill kill myself but i have tried every imaginable means to get over it for so long to no avail i still cannot convince myself that i can live without a life partner every fleeting conversation with a woman gives me hope that is immediately dashed every time i hear other people setting each other up i want to jump in front of a train i even try to stay home and avoid women as much as possible but that leads to other things that remind me of themthere is just no way out of this i cannot even kill myself because there is always the carrot of tomorrow maybe tomorrow i will meet the one but deep down i know there is no hope i cannot compete with other dudes i have accepted as fact that i will never marry my life is so meaningless my friends family are tired of me i never get better i cannot even tell them its bad again or ill let them down i feel that they are better without me i feel so alone and i feel like a failure i want to slit my wrists like ruby lane from fear street rant i guess anyone please i just want someone can i just complain to someone about my loneliness tonight lol you all should be glad \\x85 no it will not get better you will find someone eventually no i will not i have not yet no one wants to be with me and i think i have a lot to offer this shit fucking sucks i hate my life i hate being alone i regularly think about ending it all only reason i have not pulled the trigger yet is my pets i am sick of being single and lonely i fucking hate my job and i hate everything in my life other than my pets and a few friends i am destined to be forever alone i am so tired of empty platitudes i really wanted to go to my newlydiscovered favorite shop by myself tomorrow i have got some ideas of nice things i wanted to get that might help make me feel better in an area that feels good and right i think i need to make it through the night so that i can do that if i do stupid things tonight then i cannot go if i hurt myself too badly i cannot go if i do something stupid i cannot go i need to at least make it through for that i think i want to do this tomorrow it seems like everything nowadays makes me want to die i cannot remember the last time i was ever happy like i am always in a state of depression or disassociation i do not find anything i do to be interesting or fun if anything the things i do during the day are just white noise for time to pass by i have no friends and an abusive family i feel invisible every single day i have noticed that all the posts i look at for solutions to a quick painless death are just so demeaning they make it seem like your the one that is stupid and brainless honestly makes me want to die more which is ironic since those posts themselves practically beg you to stay alivethis post is not really anything i just needed to vent thinking about overdosing soon but there is no deadline for that i do not want to exist everything i do i just feel annoyed irritated lose interest and lose focus i feel weak and tired i tried sleeping but i wake up shortly after when i had this short dream there was a rope from the ceiling a thick rope i was in my bed and the rope was hanging beside me i do not know why but in that dream i grabbed the rope and it suddenly tightened around my neck and i cannot breathe i keep struggling and then i found myself on my bed again every time i try to sleep all i can think of is how i accidentally commit suicide in different ways and i cannot go back if only i am not afraid of what comes after if only i do not have to keep having these feelings and thoughts why am i so ungrateful with my life i get that feeling again i never got rid of a lot of my remaining pills like mental health pills totally forgot which ones but i have a bucket of them and they are feeling tempting to figure out how much it would take i also have some amoxicillin left and like full things of adviltylenol and just random stuff like that that is bad right that is a bad idea like that is bad right to think about using all the pills i have not discarded is a bad idea right when does it get better when does it stop when do i stop being this way when does it end when will i feel better what the fuck is fucking wrong with me why am i fucking like this what the actual fuck i am not even supposed to be here i am not here but i am here but i shoudlnt be here i should be gone i do not deserve to be here what the fuck support here would help literally trying to talk him off a ledge a new dad is about to harm himself i feel the worst i ever felt in my life i am having some very negative thoughts that even scare me i feel i am really hitting rock bottom what do i do i really need help and some one to talk to me rn i will be using letters instead of namesmy friend n is the reason i am alive today we have been friends for a long time and hes the closest friend i have ever had i introduced him to my online friend t a month or two ago and they have been inseparable ever since i cannot text either of them because they say that they cannot talk because they are talking to the other so i am all by myself now i tried to kill myself a little while ago but it did not work i thought well even if it did not work maybe something will changenothing has changed in fact things have only gotten worse i am being completely ignored i lost two valuable friends t because i was an idiot and introduced him to n and n because i am not enough n was the only thing keeping me alive and now that i have been replaced i do not have anymore value but what if i try and fail again what then all i will have accomplished is making everyone around me feel like shit i do not know what to do anymore i feel so stuck i wish i was never even born so many people could have lived a better life if i was not born i am just an expendable sack of flesh and bones why should anyone care about me i cannot believe i ever thought i was important to n it was stupid of me really i have never been important to anyone so why did i think he was different even so he is the most amazing person i have ever met and i will never forget him i hope he knows thatidk what else to say i think i am done anyone got something to say that might be helpful i did not realize i could be so easily replaced i wrote out my will and chose the way i want to go i am just sitting and waiting for the day i still have a lot to throw out but i am going to leave a few things behind that ppl can still get use out of it feels relieving to know i will not be suffering so greatly anymore soon the worst is knowing everyone who did not care about you when you were around are going to be up in arms when you are gone it irks me to think about but not enough to keep me alive lol i picked a day so i broke up with my boyfriend telling him i need a break the reason being i am only 22 and hes 27 and he wants to be with me forever he said i am the one for him i have a disorganised attachment style meaning i am pulled between desperately wanting affection anxious to not wanting any affection at all and wanting to just end the relationship because i feel its an attack on my independence avoidant he said he loves me and will wait for me i said i will only need a few weeks or a month or something to get myself together i just feel locked in like i am so young and will be with this person forever hes perfect for me when i was feeling suicidal once he took 2 days off work to be with me to make sure i am okay hes a good communicator he cares and loves me there is no drama as i am used to in other relationships so anyway the night i broke up with him i got insanely drunk and ended up going to a former fwb house and had sex with him i also messaged one of my co workers for sex so embarrassing because hes the type that will tell everyone at work and make me look like a desperate slag then the next day i had to work despite being super hung over like not in the sick way just my whole body could not stop shaking whenever i tried to serve a customer id shake uncontrollably and had to go out the back and i ended up crying anyway to sum it all up i am embarrassed like i need to quit my job right now because i never want to face any of them again and feel like my coworkers probably think i am crazy and stupid although they do know the reason i was acting that way but now all i want to do is die i have slept for almost 24 hours the most i have ever slept in my life i woke up a few times but could not bear putting up with the thoughts so i went back to sleep i feel like i have made a big mistake i have screwed up being with a guy that is perfect for me just because of my need for independence and wanting to sleep around like how ridiculous and selfish my life is a mess i have no friends and no one that cares all i want to do is take a bottle of pills and die please help i broke up with my boyfriend 2 days ago now i feel so suicidal please help i started a new job on monday leaving my parents alone on the family businness because i had consant conflict with themi feel bad now plus i feel like i can never be usefull in my new jobi restarted to have suicide toughts i just do not want to search for another job and i do not want to stick in this oneif it does not get better i will probably go to thorw myself off a bridge in the weekend hopeless i just went to my uncle i want to know what would happen if i commited suicide there  suicide in veccation  that the odds of my existence was so slim it was near impossible the 1inamillion sperm to win the race with only 1 limited life to live and i was born disabled lmao now that is a sick joke if i have ever seen one it is like i won but i actually really lost hard it is got to be some kind of joke there are people constantly telling me to hurt myself in different ways and the only way to get them to tstop talking is to do what they say but it is escalating and i do not really want to die right now the other day i thought if i cut deep enough into my thigh i could cut one of the voices out somehow but i just ended up bleeding a lot and getting stitches i also thought maybe one was in my tattoo but i cannot get the image off i have scratched the face of the tattoo out with a boxcutter but it is still talking my medicaiton is still working into my system so this is not going to stop yet i know if i were to die the voices would stop but that is not what i want right now what do i do schizophrenic help please help me i just cannot fucking deal with it anymore i just want to take all my pills tomorrow when my husband is gone for work and not show up to my job will they even fucking care ot i will slit my wrists in the tub noting helps my cat is dying and it is my fault i cannot help himive failed my marriage with my fucking problemshell be better riff without me i just want to die death does not scare me nor does any shitty thing that could occur in life fear can no longer limit me being suicidal is a positive feeling for me because nothing scares me anymore they are really cool and i am literally so alone and i feel like i have to i cannot just keep sitting here and hoping i die i also cannot just die and i cannot just cut again this is stupid

that i did wake up i cannot remember the last time i felt happy or even okay i make it through the days for my kids but i feel like i could be a much better mom if i did not want to die maybe i would have more motivation to play or actually cook dinner more than once every few weeks but everything is too much i feel so alone and have very little help feeling like a shitty mom doe help i need a break but even if the opportunity came up i would feel guilty for leaving my kids especially a newborn how do i know the difference between postpartum depression and regular depression is this going to get better in a few months i am not okay and i have no one postpartum please anyone i just want to be cared ab and loved i have no one no one cares until its too late and i am getting to the point where death seems better than this shit no one thinks ill do it but when i do they will wish they paid more attention to it and they will wish they could have stopped it i have no one i have been having these thoughts since i was in 4th grade i am now a junior in high school people think i am a happy person and i am always okay but i am trying so hard to keep everything in recently i have been giving so many warning signs that are so blatantly obvious i do not know what else to do no one thinks you will do it until its too late you are most likely imaginarybut i love you like

basic to piercing they just will not quit just here to torture me lots of therapy and they say its all up to me be positive yeah right nice touch to flip the game against the client how the hell can i do that if i could do that why would i see a therapist to tell me i have to fix myself a bum on the street can tell me that for free  no appointment needed no violent methods here have it set up to go in my sleep peaceful i was holding out to spare those around me that may be affected but at the end of the day its just you all alone and your own decision path going to end it get daily headaches i never asked for such a bad life like this i think i am going to kill myself i have known a long time now that suicide is for me that sounds really weird but essentially i genuinely feel my birth was a mistake and i do not belong on this planet i am tired of trying to fit in just to feel something only for it to backfire and because me more pain the fact i need antidepressants feels like more of a conformation that i do not belong here than anything death is the answeri would have done it over a year ago but i bought into the propaganda and got help i have been basically shuffling my feet waiting for something to happen ever since and i am doneit will probably be a few months at the latest now i get to have all the fun of planning my perfect last day and the lead up yay probably going to do it soon no one love me anymore that is all i am now unloved forever worth it i was going to hang myself last sunday but i got too scared and did not i fucking hate myself for being a coward i could not even do that i fucking hate that i hate myself i do not know why i am like this but now i know better and how to deal with this mindset i am determined to do this i have a full plan now i am not going to run away this time i was too afraid to take my life the first time i have not been happy in so long i have been sleeping all day because being awake takes too much effort when i cannot sleep i just do drugs because at least that is better than being sober i am going to college in 3 weeks and i have no idea if i am ready and i do not want to go i have always felt alone even though i have always had friends nobody gets me and the one person who does is my gf of 3 years who is going to college a ways away from me i have been wanting to die for so long and i feel like hopeless and unhappy i want to die this is a long post and is all over the place i have to rant as i cannot ever physically say my emotions or feelings and therefore cannot tell my own therapist about this or anyone really i have been suicidal since i was at least 13 there are notes as far back as 9 saying i might as well die to my doctors my home life was never goodi have always said ill die by 40 if i make no progress but it often feels like the earlier the better my guilty conscience leads me to wait until my family is older i have been struggling with burnout and usually no one notices in my family and ignores me probably my fault since i get irritable for reference i am autistic aspergers have adhd anxiety and depression the latter three since i was 6 years old my little sister came into my room tonight and made me dinner leftovers she knows i do not eat regular meals i forget or food just is not appealing i am very picky and she knows me by now pretty sure she heard me crying and saw me cry earlier today but its making me cry more that she even noticed maybe she did not notice but i know she caught on as i was crying as she brought me food i know i have my own issues but both of my little siblings are or have been suicidal and hospitalized and i just do not want to add on any pressure to anyone in my family my older sister has a kid and a divorce at a young age and is unstable in many ways but i am 25 now and its breaking me feeling so alone and i cannot be perfect i have had to put on a show since my two little sisters came into my life when i was 15 when my mom got married which i would not ever trade it was a good thing i got my act together but instead just have the same issues i did at age 9 at age 25 and have not progressed socially at all i have not dated never been asked out i lose friends due to being impulsive and saying the wrong things people say i am nice but somehow all of my relationships are superficial no one reaches out to me for actual conversation unless they need something i realized i am starting to suffer severe burn out doctors notes say at age 13 i said ill stay in my room and just not talk i have done that since and did not even know i saw that my memory itself it very poor but here is the catch how do you deal with burn out when you cannot ever express your true emotions i always lie on impulse and say i am watching a sad movie which is what i did today and i referenced a movie i cried to recently called ride your wave i do not think i can be vulnerable therapy and medicine has not helped this because i am too stubborn to open my mouth and say more that the bare minimum i either lie or get so angry if i have to express the truth so i never express the truth the anger is really me just being overwhelmed and i know that others cannot take that well and resent me for it i was chastised far too often and hit too often as a kid for my fits to be fair i hit too my parents never cared for positive reinforcement or bothered learning how to soothe a mentally ill child my mother never listened to my doctors when they said she should try complimenting me for once they legit said this as she was negative in my doctor appointmentshow can i be vulnerable when no one ever took me serious enough when i struggled the most and it came off as anger i got tossed aside so my little sisters could get the help they needed since i got good grades my own stubbornness makes it so no one wants to help me or ask how i am or how i feel i just answer i am fine its stifling i never meant to push anyone away but why does no one ask me how i am or press further it hurts sometimes i hate living with these conditions and nights like tonight when my little sister came into my room give me some hope i am not completely hopeless but 10 25 years of working my ass off to feel like i have not gotten anywhere socially and i still cannot cook well and cannot get out of my room people say to just trydo it i try it and fail i get overwhelmed and cannot do it again i am trying hard and they know i am behind but it seems i can only help myself but i just have not been able to i know at this point i need to do things alone but how do i start not to mention there is no new psychiatrist available until october online ones exist but cannot prescribe the stimulant i take i am just stuck thanks for reading i am just not sure ill be here when i am middle age if i do not progress or even a year being behind is hard and people make fun of you if you are a picky eater or are a creature of habit but i cannot help it why cannot people be more understanding why cannot i understand myself its a two way compromise but i am so stubborn i get nowhere how much longer and that is fucking disgusting this is why the world should be hit by a meteorite and destroy the scum of humanity people make fun of suicidal people i will not lie i put on a good poker face so that when people look at me it seems like my life is sunshine and rainbows hell i have even had people tell me that it seems like i live a fun life i am young fit pretty successful for my age and not an ugly looking person underneath all of this there is an insecure little boy that suffered from sexual assault as a child severe bullying had an eating disorder for 8 years has mentally abusive parentshas been in toxic relationships and has panicanxiety attacks every night i do not actually have any close friends despite having people that want to be friends with me when i try to talk to people it does not feel genuine or they have this expectation of me based on my image that does not reflect who i am as a person its exhausting that people think i am a huge ball of fun energy and loves to party that is not who i am at all and when they find out how i actually am as a person it sucks because i literally see them lose interest in me my family raised me and distilled values of perfectionism and reputation to the point that they stripped me of any bit of originality when i try to be myself around them i get told i am being weird or what will people think about you my own mother calls me ugly and points out the smallest imperfectionsi go on dates and people just want to have sex with me for my body and when i want to develop an emotional connection i get blown off  often times because the other side did not expect me to be as emotional as i am and it scares them i feel like i have no one to be vulnerable with and it makes me feel so unbelievably lonely the thing is i do not think i have ever felt like i was not lonely who am i living for what am i even working so hard for how did i even get this far on the outside everything looks perfect whenever i see couples whether online or in person i instantly get an intense wave of sadness i soon start to dwell over it and i start to get suicidal ideation love is the one thing in my life that is lacking i can never get a boyfriend no matter how hard i try its also the main reason why i am suicidal does anyone else ever feel this way whenever they see lovers i am having one of those nights and i want to die couples i work in a shop its not even been a month yet i have already come to hate my job i feel so broken down and just totally drained physically and emotionally i cry every morning before i leave for work and i sobbed my eyes out in the bathroom yesterday for the entire lunch break i am in the bathroom crying again now i would literally give anything to be able to quit i was 16 the last time i attempted suicide and i am honestly getting really strong suicidal thoughts now i feel so trapped and helpless and alone crazy thing is i used to work in 2 other shops before and i loved my job then i really do not know what went wrong this time i am desperately unhappy at my job to the point where i am considering suicide i am just so tired of living everything is just soapathetic almost gray if that makes sense idki have isolated myself from all my friends i just sit around all day and be a waste of space to my family my bf is probably bored of me what have i actually contributed to this world  literally nothingi am useless waste of everyone is time and money i am nothing i do not matter nothing matters anymore nothing matters i hate who i am right now at age 28 i feel like i failed highly in my relationships family peers etc i hate having autism with disabilities and mental illness i am catholic and try to keep my faith highly feeling suicidal ideation i cannot live with my anxiety anymore i cannot handle it not in a life like this i just hope if there is something after this life it will be more kind to me then this life was everything i have had to go through in my life has lead to nothing but more suffering more pain it is a cruel fucking random game life is i do not see any reason to live anymore nobody in my house listens to me i guess talking to me about literally fucking anything is the most difficult thing ever every god damn thing yet they can criticize me however they want i am lazy i am ignorant i am negative i am crazy fucking assholes some people were not meant to be fucking parents i will tell you that right now sharing anything with them is like talking to a god damn brick wall my entire life you have just yelled at me and never pushed me to do anything out of my comfort zone now because of that i am just useless that is all i will ever bei do not have any friends either nobody who gives a fuck enough to listen to me anyways which is fine i do not expect anyone to be friends with a mentally ill depressed awkward fucking retard tbh if i was in their shoes i would probably do the same so no hard feelings there  part of me feels bad for doing this now considering what just happened in my moms family 4 days ago i wish i could push myself to stay a little longer and did not have to put her through losing someone else but i do not think i would be able to help her anyway i feel like putting her through this now instead of later when she just started healing would be lesscruel but i do not know i just hope my dad will be able to help her through this but i cannot continue i do not want to continue i do not want to waste so much pointless fucking energy just to grow old and die alone i do not want to continue living in a fucking awful home filled with people who do not even acknowledge me i do not want to continue being alone while everyone around me has some connection to something or someone so i am done i do not want to continue i am pissed i am depressed i am done i might vent a lot but mostly i do not want to feel alone tonight even tho i am can someone please talk to me i do not want to live anymore what is the point my family does not give a shit about me they tell me i am weak all the time since i was a kid i feel worthless i cannot handle these fucking emotions dying keeps seeming like a better option than living i feel so so worthless what is the point i do not feel loved by my family they constantly put me down and criticize me i am not happy with living i do not want to be here i do not want to live 23 m i come to this sub every now and then for something to relate to to hear about people who seem to be experiencing life the way i am it does not matter what life events are occurring good or bad people of all ages are impacted by depressive thoughts and ultimately suicidal ideation i really do not know if i could ever do it i think about it all the time even while enjoying the time i spend alive recently more than ever it just seems like a real possibility something to almost look forward too i cannot think about it without thinking about the people who know me and love me the problems it may because for them is the main reason i do not do it when i think about it i also think about the larger picture the reality of this situation i understand that even in our darkest moments tormented by our thoughts and clinging to life by whatever threads we have left we still do things like this like reaching out on this sub as small as this action is its so powerful everyone reaching out and opening up on this thread is so powerful so desperate to live even when all hope is seemingly lost we compile our thoughts and essentially throw a lifeline in an attempt to save our own lives think about how amazing that is even if we feel so unloved so hopeless so lost ashamed abandoned dreadful or sorry we still reach out in order to save our own lives we reach out to beautiful strangers on this app to assist us in this journey of life to give us just something anything to survive or at least make it easier to live a little longer we are our own friends we are the people who unconditionally love ourselves we are programmed to keep fighting typing a message and sending it on this sub is a huge testament to our strength as humans you may want to die but in the most sincere and loving way i can possibly say this you reach out here you read these messages because you simply want to live i hope that no matter what you choose to do in your life you realize the power you have over yourself and your ability to change your own world you are your own beautiful lifeline whether you realize that or not here i am again for a while everythings been ideation mostly it still is but the ideas are becoming real a plan is forming in my head details to be decided obstacles to circumvent an idea has taken hold finally forming a plan i decided to stop cutting myself but i still got the habit to hurt myself when i am overwhelmed so i end up hanging myself in my closet until i can handle it when i feel like i am just about to pass out i get up and suddenly feel much better hopefully one day my legs give up on me so i can finally end up killing myself new habit does anyone have any tips for anxiety and suicidal thoughts tips this will probably be my last post i feel no reason to live my life is just empty i am going to stab myself i am going to kill myself i had a fairly decent life untill i grow up and i always helped people who had a idea of killing themselves many times back in highschool so this is not a random topic for me i believe i have changed many peoples mind and helped them get better but for the last few years things started to fell off one by onewhat exactly do i mean by started to fell off the girl i met in high school and then become lovers died after 4 years of dating after high school family is also non existant had health issues etci was pretty okay with many stuff starting the life without a lack of family having hard time to find my place in the social life and such and always felt strong enough to deal with everything but as the time goes i just got tired of being strong acting strong trying to implement myself in to social life and finding people to bond with have a good time withand recently by losing the last person i felt some connection to the world being gone and myself having some health issues that may or may not be important having to lose all my friends and now that not being able to find new people and such i just got really tired really tired i carried so much stuff as a child and a grown up but somehow i am now exhausted i never thought i will be this tired in life like everi always been a observer but i am tired of being one because i cannot fit myself in to anything nowadays and i am tired of seeing people being happy with somethingsomeone i started to get jealous and question my life and found the details i ignored all this timethat questioning part lead me to asking did i really deserved everything because should not that be go like bad things happen then you get some happiness and then it gets a straight line for normal and always climbs up for people who are extremely lucky i know there is no rule this is just a random vent i guessi concluded on that i do not deserve to be alive and i do not fit in anywhere in life anymore so therefore i believe that i should just give up at this point because i had enough i tried enough i fought enoughfunny part is i still love life how things go for people around me as i said i spent so much time observing them and i like how good things going for them etc i am just tired of mine going flat down with everything literally everythingi kind of do not expect anything from anyone and i still have like a pages of things that i can talk about and the saddest part is i am aware of literally everything my situation what should i do how i sound etcanyways this is the chaos going on in my head that i plan to solve by giving upthank you i think i have arrived the end of this road i do not even really know how to say what i want to say all aspects of my life are fulfilled rn and i have everything physical that i could want which i do not want a lot so that part is easy  financially secure have pets that i love have a job i love have a partner and a part of me feels like that is making life worse cos i have no wants or needs right now but i still feel like not being here i just do not see a point i feel like my only purpose in life is to make others be happy or do anything that i can to make their life better but it still is not helping muchi just daydream about not being here anymore there is a quote that i read death must be so beautiful to lie in the soft brown earth with the grasses waving above ones head and listen to silence to have no yesterday and no tomorrow to forget time to forgive life to be at peace and that is all that i hope for these days i so badly just want to get a bottle of alcohol call an uber go to the nearest bridge and just let go of everything and forget existing i feel like i was not meant for this world i do not think i have ever truly been happy i know nobody can help but i just wish that something could help this it sucks feeling this way and just constantly wanting to do that  life is so empty sometimes but its doubtful anyone does or will again i am not worth anyones time idiot loser i had multiple chances and i sabotaged them all sorry if you are reading this just move on i do not want comfort i want to disappear i would really like to believe anyone cared death is really the only truly permanent thing we have every time i am happy i know that ill just go back to being sad that is my default stateevery time i think of anything else ill inevitably think about my trauma againdeath solves both of those things i know that nothing awaits me when i die i cannot think anymore my trauma cannot haunt me i will not ever feel happiness but more importantly ill never feel sadness ill never have to feel like i need to starve myself to be pretty again ill never have to worry again about fucking up my life even worse its comforting knowing that i am going to end all of that for the first time ill have peace every decision i make is wrong and every feeling of joy is fleeting like who do i need to proof my worth to random strangwr i will never talk toor myselfi do not know like why tf should i care if others see my worth because i do not see it others say i am kind and can appreciate others for who they are ok fine but how does this add or reduce anything to my worthsorry might be the wrong subreddit what is the concept of worth i just cannot anymore i cannot kind of hard to explain in full detail but i kind of always thought i was a worthless piece of shit but also thought hey i am kind of better than other people at this one thing which was useful as a job so i figured i would just tough life out so my parents would not be sad and all that stuff but recently i realized that no actually you are not very good at your job you should have been fired years ago you cannot get a new job and you are too useless to do anything else so my options are essentially to leech off my parents for my whole life or be homeless or possibly constantly get hired on for low wage menial work and be fired within a few weeks for sucking i choose option 4 as i do not see any value in life anyway my desire to not have my parents be sad is no longer strong enough to keep me here too bad for them that they took the chance and had a child i am only partially delaying as the method i have chosen could be dangerous to people so i am trying to figure out how to avoid anyone getting hurt it should be quick and relatively painless though i just need a very empty space or something to counteract the toxicity after i perish of course i would prefer to have nembutal but getting your hands on it is such a hassle and it is hard to be sure you are actually getting nembutal if you try to get it from seedy sources i bought a shit ton of candy and sweets and am enjoying eating them though probably actually truly enjoying them for the first time in my life since i am no longer thinking boy i should not be eating this crap pretty sure i will kill myself soon to my single father who raised me for the past decade i am sorry i hope in the next life you get a stronger daughter you deserve better i am sorry apology i triedi foughti wanted to livei dreamed but i am sorryi am too tireda will into a resentmenta fight into cowardicea dream into a nightmaremy tears full of saltand remnants of a future i will not seei am sorryi am too tired i am sorry my life is not bad i do not particularly enjoy my job it is a family company and i started working there about 5 years ago to get it off the ground however now i am 27 and want to pursue a different path i have had a girlfriend for almost 7 years she is unhappy with me i do not think she will leave me though i have a major gambling issue whenever i get real anxious i find casino games get my mind off iti just wish i was not my own worst enemy i am not killing myself i am doing something worse i am tearing myself apart while everyone who i love has to watch and burden them my fear of death keeps me alive will the pain get so bad that death may sound nice i constantly have suicidal thoughts but i am too scared to die not you not one not one god damn person on this earth gives a shit if i live or die i was abused by my parents as a child and i currently still live with them as an adult because i do not have a choice the authorities have been contacted on them before but the authorities did not believe me i have no proof of the abuse and they just dismissed me and basically told me i was being a bratty ungrateful teenager to my wellmeaning but imperfect and loving parents my parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them and they successfully manipulated me into believing i am their abuser and they are my innocent victims and i tearfully apologized to them i hate myself for letting them do that but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if i did pursue legal action against them i am being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse and it is killing me this is the only place i can talk about it i currently cannot go to counseling my parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out i want so badly to get a restrainingnocontact order against them both but i have no proof abused as a child all this work all this pressure that everyone puts on you to succeed to go to a good college get a good job the normal things a lot of parents ask all for what i work my entire life and then what am i supposed to enjoy my ofttimes from studying or working being an ugly socially awkward loser not able to talk to anyone have friends even when doing normally enjoyed things video games time off etc all i can think about is how everyone else is probably enjoying their time with other people am i working for something or am i just working for the sake of working just because everyone tells me that is what i am supposed to do do people only tell you it gets better for the sake of having one more wage slave satisfy their demand for goods what is this all for all for what i know i am notmy ocd is awfulmy body dysmorphia is literally killing me i am fat and ugly my own boyfriend is secretly not attracted to me i know iti have no one to talk to because i am embarrassed about iti talk to my boyfriend but he just gets madi know i do not want to kill myself but my mental illnesses do i think i have post partum depression too still even though i am 5 months out i wonder what it is like to be mentally healthyi wonder what it feels like to be wantedit hurts so much and i am pathetic because others have it so much worse i feel so alone my girlfriend of 3 years recently committed suicide and it broke me like i feel hollow i cried for 3 days straight leading up to her funeral when i got there her mom ran up to me hitting my chest crying saying i could have stopped her and i should have know she was depressed her mom blames me for the her daughters death her husband brought her away and her sister told me i had to leave the funeral i turned away in tears crying do you honestly think i knew and did nothing about it i wish it me instead of her i swear to god i did not know she felt like that i hate myself 26 and i lost my best friend of 15 years he was the only person i thought cared about me my ex cheated on me with him and he chose her she was my first real girlfriend and i put so much into her now i have to think about how they are having a wonderful time together and i am completely alone no one will care when i am gone i have zero impact on any of the lives i am a part of everyone just tolerates me until a replacement shows up no one will care when i am gone instead of getting better i get worse i feel poisonedi take the steps i see before me and it is like the ground changes with every stepi feel lostthings i do should be making it bettereven a grain of sand at a time and all of it turns to despair i feel brokeni do not know how to make another step when i feel like all i will do is hurt everyone i seei feel poisoned by all i am i feel poisoned i have been stuck for years and there is no way to get out i was unhappy i am unhappy and will continue to be unhappy for the rest of my life i cannot claw my way out and no one even knows i am down here trapped at the bottom of a dark well does not seem like a bad idea just grab a couple dozen energy drinks and a couple pots of coffee and chug them all down in one go that cardiac arrest is probably going to hurt like a mf but my will to live is growing weaker by the day what is the point of living anymore i am tired of nightmares every night and the real world nicotine overdose might work too how many cigarettes ad vapes would it take to kill ya maybe alcohol would be the better way to go just get like fifty beers or something maybe a hundred how bout them other drugs not that i have access to them but that would be nice i know it is not funny to joke about this kind of stuff if i did not fear death or the possibility of there being an afterlife i would be gone in a flash well i guess i am slowly killing myself by smoking so maybe i should stop that not that i want to but i do not want some higher power being like hmm you smoked them cigarettes being fully aware what they do to you okay time to send another form of your consciousness to an even worse place mwhahahaha not calling it god the abrahamic deity called god is so fucking childish if there was really a creator or high power of some sort it would not be some dude that said humans were in the image of him getting angry and jealous and having three different forms yet saying they are all one maybe there is no creator or higher power and the preexistent bigbang has always existed i do not know dudes but i am sick of living but i do not want to kill myself then become something else within the universe or reality and have dark energy push me into an even worse placeor i do not know how dark matter dark energy works but something like that i feel like i am cursed to suffer for all of eternity already we are already in hell dudes is it possible to climb the ladder and find the kingdom of heaven from within i have no idea but i guess i will try again maybe some meditation or something will help me this world so fucked up yo how could i possibly know i have not been existent an infinite amount of times can you try to think back to what youit were like before you were born you cannot or at least i cannot maybe this is really the first time for existence to occur but there are theories for infinite universes so i do not know if the universe is possible then i guess anything is possible maybe i am the only one that exists and all of you and everything else is an illusion with my brain and senses acting as filters and playing tricks on me or maybe i am part of that illusion as well who is fucking dream is this world or is this dreamillusion just self reliant on its own with no one or thing to dream it an illusion implies that there is an opposite of that like a factuality or actuality or something idk i am fearful of the unknown and i do not know anything i do not have the courage to go through with it i guess i am not starving in a third world country or enslaved in human trafficking so it could be worse i suppose i am a whiny kid with a smartphone acting like a little bitch but i do have my own problems i will not lie no friends no partner work all the time idk man caffeine overdose back here again great i was doing so well these past few weeks and by so well i mean not having the urge to count every building to check if its over ten stories or feeling numb all the time but here we are all over poop i have not been able to shit for the past almost five days and spent the whole day today trying two enemas a suppository and laxatives and nothing now the thought of going to the er over shitting is so mortifying and stressenducing that i am back to my thought of just ending it all the shit is a metaphor even when you think things are getting better there will always be another shit storm waiting i am so tired crying over poop was my friends birthday today she had people all day tryna congratulate nd spend time with her i should not be but i am so jealousno one knows my birthday anymore but it is ok i only have one more so tired birthdays i cannot even hurt myself i wish you could just get euthanized right away i am trapped in this world hello i am a 16 year old out of germany that lives in mv and i came here to ask if someone is willing to help me killmyself personly i preffer a gun but other methods are also welcome so yeah me we cannot even act surprised either he told all of us how depressed he was the last time i saw him he said his mind was going to dark places the way he said it though was so ambiguous he would always smile and laugh after id give a generic response like oh do not say that or some bullshit when i found out today though it hurt in my heart because i have been thinking about it too i did not tell my friend i have said the words before to people i considered friends but no one ever knows what to say or says the right thing what do you do anymore so much pain and sadness this year i just found out my friend committed suicide i am moving on i cannot forgive them so ill just pretend they are dead or never even existed all pictures of them in my phone deleted my social media deleted its not healthy to hold a grudge this long if i am already suicidal why not just try to have a better life nothing to lose should just take the chanceif nothing matters in the end ill become a new person and meet new people worst case scenario i fail but still learn and get the experience and yes i am going through withdrawals rn instead of killing myself ill kill them in my head so uh yeah as what the title says i fucking had enough because i have been struggling with suicidal thoughts with 3 years plus self harm my family do not understand me even if they see me doing it they still tell me that i am looking for attention even i have been talking it seriously school does not help out too because they seem to keep telling me how i am being lazy to not do my work and they clearly do not give a fuck about my feelings is there any good ways to kill myself i am already planning to do so i want to kms its been on my mind for a few years now but now i have wanted to end this life of mine i have had 2 relationships both more than 7years end i cannot take this pain anymore i am in a country far away from family i do not want to go back to my family because i have failed in every single way i am scared and alone i just want this pain to stop i have tried to look up many pro suicide forums but can not find any as i sit here alone no friend in my life losing the love of my life i just need my life to end i want it to end i cannot take this pain its all my fault ending life is my peace if i waited another day or two i probably would have passed in my sleep i wish i had done that instead i may be healthy but i have no path forward i got sick and came close to dying i got the bill today going to the hospital was the biggest mistake of my life my roommates kicked me out meaning i lost my cat i just started a new job my bank account is overdrawn and it will probably close on me i do not have money to pay rent my van broke down and i do not have money to fix it i do not know what to do or how to fix myself i am in such a lonely place right now if i get locked up for needing help ill lose my new place and my new job idk how to keep moving forward when will it get better i want to die thinking of stepping into traffic i started to have this feeling just last march this year this is new to me so i am not even sure if i am already considered as having suicidal ideation whenever i have a thought about ceasing to exist i feel peace inside of me it is like escaping from a cage i have been in for so long i do not know what is this life have for me in the future and i am thinking i will just be a failure i wish i could just disappear like a bubble without having to go through physical pain but at the same time i was thinking of the people i would leave behind i do not want to exist anymore but i do not want to kill myself my sibling is trans 17 preop ftm hethem our parents are good parents some bumps here and there they are opposed to my sibling transition i support my sibling but i am not very good with words and kind of a coward i have a hard time standing up to our dad about it our dad is a good man but he is a butt sometimes he is so supportive with both of us wanting to pursue artistic careers teaching us how to be more independent and will never abandon his us he is firm about keeping us all together since he is distanced himself from certain distant family he is talked us both down from trying to kill ourselves more than once but he seems so apathetic when it comes to this i feel guilty for not being able to properly comfort them when they get depressed about it my sibling and i are both lgbtq are bipolar have depression and have anxiety so i kind of understand how it feels when dad acts like that our dad has a bisexual sister and loves her even though she always gets into trouble so i know he does not hate us for being lgbtq he is not exactly traditional either he wants his daughters to be independent so why cannot he be more supportive i think it is the transition part he does not like maybe he is scared that my sibling will hate that body as well if not worse i understand the sentiment but my sibling is dead set on developing a masculine body i want to pay for it myself but cannot i am 19 not a guardian and broke what can i do to comfort my sibling any good advice or thoughts how do i comfort my trans sibling if i did not live with my dad i would feel better about offing myself the only reason why i have not attempted yet is because i do not want him to find me before i die i do not want to risk being severely brain damaged i wish i lived alone so it would be easier to hang myself i let this happen i should not have and now i am fucking paying for it i need this to stop i swear to god i am going to kill myself before the date i gave myself i feel so unbelievably guilty every single day my body gets worse and i my brain is just on slow mode or some shit help me i am a horrible person hellomy father who is quite abusive and never took care of me during my childhood told me i need to decide whether i want to continue to live after i told him i can not survive the abuse and trauma i experienced and expressed my anger that he never helped me or protected me he told me he has no fault since he had his own struggles and i should stop always dwelling on the past however the present is destroyed by the past i guess i should not have expected anything else since this man never seemed to care much father told me its my decision m 20 so i am writing this cuse iv been wanting to get it off my chest iv tried killing my self last week by overdosing and sent to the hospital then to a mental health facility i got out in 4 days and when i was in there i was feeling a lot better and thought i can do this but when i got out i realized that i am back were i started i am on antidepressants but you still have suicide thoughts and still depressed its so weird that i am alive and i have to work and live idk how to explain that but i was not ready to keep going with life i think about wanted to die again still depressed i do not really have a purpose or some that cares about me i just want to be loved and wanted iv been bullied in high school cuse i was special ed and really quite it felt like if i said something worng or stupid they just laugh i just struggled with my math and english because i was in special ed class i struggle alot in the really world like with work i had friends but i felt they just use me for my money so they were just being kind after high school so called friends started using drugs and i have stayed off that path trying to be good had a hard time talking to females very shy never went on a date to high school i wanted to date after tried dating apps went to partys and never made a connection parents are not any help when in high school they verbal abused me so that and the bulling at school fuck me up there better now but i cannot talk to them and tell them you made my life even harder i look at people i know and there happy getting married and have a good time and i ask my self why cannot i be like what is wrong with me that iv tried to put my self put there but nothing works thank you if your reading this sorry for spelling errors if your depressed or suicide you not alone it hurts so much i know hugs for evey one love i tried killing my self a week ago and still want to and my back story there is nothing in my life that i wish more than death yet i am still afraid of doing the thing i am such a coward i cannot live a life but i cannot even die what the hell am i doing here seems to me that i am just forced to sufferi really envy you americans living in the land of the free but i especially envy the second amendment of your constitutionif i was born american i could have bought a shotgun and put an end to this stupid story but i are not no american and the only way i have to take my life is through something painful or that does not grant instant death should i hang myself if i cannot achieve a full suspension hell no low suspension method is too risky takes too much time and there is always a chance for an hero to appear imagine living a life with a brain that is so rotten it does not allow you to wipe your ass it would be surprisingly worse than before then should i just jump from height and what if i cannot manage to land on the head it will be an excruciatingly way to leave this place and i do not want to suffer more than i have already did in my life what other choices do i have left i do not know i am not very smart and i cannot think of a painlessly way to die on my own but if you try to search on the internet for a way to do it you will only get suicide hotlines numbers and related stuffeverything related to suicide is literally censored we basically have no right to die in this sick cruel world to the extent that we are forced to stay here just waiting for the death to come that is sick why is that so it feels cruel to force people living a life of pain and suffering it feels scary to think you do not have the right to take your own life i am just waiting for the death to come sitting in the car on the way back to las vegas from the grand canyon with my boyfriend and his family on a vacation silently crying because you want to slit your wrists is just a whole nother type of feeling want to slit my wrists i do not want to fail again all i have done since i have been alive is fail or fuck up i am just tired and i want to end it all i do not even care if it hurts anymore i just want to be gone i do not sleep i feel nauseous when i see food i hate my body and my self more than ever i do not feel like anyone cares the only thing that makes my life feel like i need to stay longer is my first child is on the way but my partner just does not care about how i feel or how i am feeling about my life our life she just tells me to go back to my family who let me go homeless until i met her i do not want to make anybody disappointed in me but i do not think ill do anything worth being alive for i cannot do anything anymore i do not want therapy or meds i did that and it just made it hard to move i still have thoughts of hurting myself and rotting i am so sad and tired i do not want to be me anymore i cannot keep feeling feelings i do not want to be here but if i die ill still make everyone disappointed i do not care what people are going to tell me i just cannot keep bottling up i am so close to hurting myself and ending it i am tired and overwhelmed but no one cares i want to be dead i want to boil i am so tired of seeing my face hearing myself breathing i hate eating i hate food i hate everything i want to be dead i hate people i hate life i do not want to but i do not want to be alive anymore what else to add i did not chose to become pregnant and a single mother there is more story to this but i do not want to write too much right now as it is really traumatic for memy parents basically pressured me into keeping the child but tbh i do not know if i would have been able to get a abortion mentally if they were not involvedi love my little one i really do now it is too late anyway i will do my best to care for my baby but i am suffering i would honestly kill myself if i were not pregnanta parent to a child who needs me how can i manage the pain for at least 18 years from now on i am only 20 yo and have no friends i just have my close family stepfather mother younger brother and it is currently very stressful at home they fight a lot and i feel like a burden to them but i have no alternative nowhere else to gothey told me that i and their future grandchild can stay with them and they will support me i would leave and make it easier for them but i obviously cannot make this decision bc of my loi have no other option than staying with them i am financially unstable and basically a failed human being not able to care for myself and my child i am in a very bad mental state right now and i do not know how to manage anymore professional helphospital is no option i do not have that much money and cannot expect my parents to pay i already was diagnosed in the past but my parents basically undiagnosed me as they know better than all of the mental health professionals i have seen in the past i feel so bad for even having this kind of thoughts but i kind of wish i will die due to birth complications nobody would consider blaming mei am such an asshole for even thinking that i knowi am so sorry my little one mummy is trying very hard to stay safe for you do not worry guys i would never do intentional harm to myself as long as baby is inside of me i love him so much and he is the only reason i am still alive i sadly cannot talk to anyone about this i am so lonelythanks for reading i want to stop existing but i am 33 weeks pregnant so i cannot do anything but suffer for the next at least 18 years i started cutting myself why did i get such a difficult life why did my stupid parents have to fucki have it in me but i just do not want to do it anymore it is not worth ir i am fucking tired of being sober i want out i want out i want out nothing gets better do not give me false hope why was i born i have no fucking clue why is there no way to leave but to execute and experience pain in a reality i was forced to fucking exist ini want death to hold and fly me serenely to the emptiness and void i lived in before i was brought into this hellhole escape i failed an attempt a week back and have not told anyone or really unpacked it i broke down when it failed but i have been numb ever since when i thought i was dying i did not feel scared i felt relieved i felt better than i have in so so long i found myself dwelling on whether or not anything would happen after i die or if my consciousness would simply cease to exist and the thought of nothingness did not bother me at all i cannot believe a week has already passed nothing changed i want to try again but it is hard to come up with another method in my situationit bothers me that i have to put so much thought into carefully planning my escape why are we forced to live against our will i would not have to resort to such awful methods if i could be straightforward and honest instead i am paranoid about raising suspicion and have to avoid so many methods that would be quick and painless simply because i cannot risk anyone finding out it is absurdpart of me is disappointed that it was so easy to pick myself up and recover from my attempt makes me feel like i did not get close at all the other part of me is glad that i do not have any lasting symptoms life does not need to be more painful than it already isnot sure what this post is supposed to be this community cannot help me but at least i can talk about things that i cannot normally talk about failed attempt excuse my bad englishsince my 14yo i search a painless death i know my place is not on earth and i just do not want to live i have tested many things and it did not work i would like someone to give me a good way to kill myself without painthank you in advance 5 long years i am freaking out and i feel like i am in a crisis and i just do not know what to do i have no way to get support rn because my mom is busy and i do not have therapy until friday and my therapist wants to make me switch therapists anyway so i feel like i am losing my support system i just do not know how to get through this i feel like i am at my breaking point someone please help me i do not know what to do i have worked for everybody so much to the point where id rather stick 10 razer blades up my ass but all i hear from my family is he never does anything and i am so sick of it i should just stop caring if what i do for everybody is just nonexistent to them i have worked to the point where i have had 12 suicide attempts 5 of which were in a single week and i am going to keep trying my effort is never truly appreciated do not know what to call it but a person i go talk to and they give me advice and help me understand myself and my feelings betteri do not want to go i am the one who wanted help but it causes me so much pressure i feel like my problems are not enough big and that there are a lot of people who need the help over me i do not take the advice she gives me and going there i just wait for it to be over it makes me feel sad when she makes me think about my emotions i am too tired to go not because lack of sleeping i have just had this weird issue of being too tired emotionally and not really able to do shit because of that do not know why and it is starting to feel useless to go because i keep most of the things inside of me and overthink it would be so much easier to just stay at home and act happy no one understands anyways i cannot find a way to tell her i do not want to go anymore and at this point i feel like help is useless it will not help anyways and i am not going to have any dreams for the future because i do not want to stay i just want to have my last night of sleep last meal and last gaming session and then end it all that would be a thousand times easier and end the pain i do not really mind dying because i have no dreams and i am just living my boring npc life it does not even feel sad to leave everything except friends and family but i am sure that is not going to stop me if i really choose to end it all i do not want to go to therapy anymore i am 14 55kg and 54 is 600mg of prozac enough to kill me please i need this nightmare to end i cannot kill myself any other way i do not care if it is painful i want to die 600mg of prozac enough to kill i am exhausted in life i have no drive or motivation to do anything anymore i have been like this for a long time i live in a country that is falling apart my family is falling apart and my mental health is falling apart there is been times where i have been so low that i go to bed hoping i never wake up and die in my sleep it would be better that way i cannot do this anymore i do not have any friends or girlfriend so i will not be missed and it will not matter i want to kms my college annouced the last date to register for next semester and it is 16th august and i do not want to be burden physically and financially on my family anymore i am not fully prepared that how i am going to do this but i just want to end this i cannot take anymore everyday i feel ashamed of myself more and more i do not deserve to live this life many people are there who are not provided with everything i got and they are still giving their best and working their ass off i just want to end it without much pain but i know it will not i have tried before and it is not that easy let us see what i can prepare myself in these 1520 days today i got the date before i have to die i am in my early thirties but i have had chronic suicidal ideation since age 14 i remember the first time as if it were yesterday part of me is proud i made it to 33 but i do not think i am going to last much longer i feel weak for giving into the negative thoughts but i just do not think i can keep up the facade anymore i have high functioning asd aspergers and trying to fit in and form relationships has just grown far too exhausting wish you all the best in this subreddit reading many posts over the last month has given me some hope and inspiration in knowing i am not alone with these struggles you made an impact on me thank you i can feel it coming you know what is weird i have tried to commit suicide multiple times and sometimes after an attempt i am too afraid to go to sleep because i am afraid i might die like that does not make any sense and sometimes after an attempt i try to go sleep as soon as possible so id die my mind is so weird idk what is wrong with me i always have the irrational thought to do something incredibly fucked up and make them all hate me so they are not upset when i finally do it thinking of ending it very soon but i am afraid of upsetting family and friends took over 500mg of amitriptyline and tried to put my head into a makeshift suicide bag but i passed out before i can do it i woke up 20 hours later delirious and high on meds i fail at everything in life now even suicide what is the point of anything anymore i tried to complex suicide and i failed i want to kms as a means of avoidance i am too tired for life and i am tired of having to run away from my own mind at 100 mph i probably have ocd and my stupid meds do not fucking work i hate it they made me jittery like a shot of adrenaline and cloudy at the same time so i stopped taking them that were my last hope its just kind of sad knowing that some people just get the short end of the stick and there is nothing you can do about it and even sadder knowing that i am one of those people i got a shit life and a shit brain that nobody understands it all just makes life seem kind of empty and pointless i am so tired of living on the outside of my body i cannot fucking do this anymore it hurts even more having to see my moms face everyday finally happy and stable unknowing that i am going to put a bullet in my brain soon i already got the gun my mom does not know that i am going to put a bullet in my brain soon i am just not going to speek i hurt people creep them out or annoy them i am already not part of society so i may asweelll not speek to anyone i

friends but i will not hang out with them may aswell forget will not see them ever again in a couple of years when i go back to school i am going to stay away from everyone and not speek do not want to die but i do not have any other options i do not want to do it but its more like i have to do it i am just done with everything i honestly have been feeling like i have no care to the world that is including my own life its hard to see any positives and i have felt super numbed down with emotions lately and just do not see the point of a lot of things that i just say fuck it who cares anymore i feel like nothing and nobody i do not deserve to live i do not want to live nothing i do contributes to anything good i hurt everyone around me nobody likes me every second i am alive is absolute torture so why am i alive why am i alive too tired to even kill myself tired i am not scared of dying anymore i have reached the point of where nothing makes me happy i should be happy going from inpatient to further treatment and now a job but i am not i use to be deathly scared of dying and how it affects my family i do not care anymore i am in so much emotional pain i just do not want to keep going through the emotional anguish and trauma it hurts too much i feel like a disappointment and failure to everyone i feel like my depression has been masked for awhile and its just coming out full force wanting me to just end it i wish you all the best in your similar struggles i am ready to go out i am now on vacation so i am not going to commit suicide until july 30th but idk what to do when i am home i have a plan first i am going to drink a lot of alcohol and then swallow a bunch of pills i am so donei hate everything ocd anxiety depression and especially ptsd tw i am so tired does anyone here have experience with carbon monoxide and what kind of brain damage does it because i am pretty sure it is how i want to go out but i do not want anything to go wrong and i would be a vegetable for the rest of my miserable life carbon monoxide brain damage hopefully my behaviour can help find out why i tend to be very apathetic apart from when i am stuck into researching my favourite subject which is nutrition and have become very impatient with my former favourite hobby i engaged in to relieve boredom which are video games i have some suicidal ideation because nutrition can only provide so much information and find it extremely difficult to start new hobbies like learning an instrument i have so far failed to mention my autism which i inherited from my purely parental lineage and had diagnosed from a professional and autism has been linked with depression although i do doubt my diagnosis to a small degree my heart rate is in the 90s which is a possible indicator that something is wrong with me since higher heart rates are linked with depression shorter life spans and a greater chance of cvd although i am exercising and eating some legumes to lower it as much as possible i am taking lamogtrigine which is supposed to stabilize my mood as my consultant thinks that i may have bipolar and i am growing some broccoli sprouts to treat my autism as it is the only shown treatment of autism there is if i even have it in the first placei am whole food starch based but i understand if you do not want to leave animal products behind as my oldest sister still likes themmy main issue with making friends is anticipatory anxiety possibly induced by church up until we stopped attending much to the dismay of the pastors at 14 and maybe attending school at 14 after a history of only homeschooling i am completely fine in the presence of others like at school and can tolerate them fairly well outside of regular social meetings but the main reward is walking out of the regular meetings for sure knowing i have some time before i encounter them again quickly going back to nutrition i think i might be deficient in both calcium and magnesium which seem to have a role in mood alongside the obvious ones being bones and muscles and i am also taking ashwaganda my grandfather on my fathers side the autistic and very quiet one who only every talked to my mother once in his entire life thankfully it being the pleasant topic of his civil engineering career he shook hands with the queen for an important construction project once despite being very middle class i also have problems falling asleep at regular times but no issue getting it consistently i must further mention that i have had severe seperation anxiety based on my mother to the point where i very rarely could be left with strangers and could not even be held by my own father who has suffered from general anxiety for as long as he can rememberi grew up in a christian community and also a completely secular sailing club which gave me the feeling of being jekyll and hyde before having known about the book but both feelings where equally enjoyable although i was in a christian environment much more this was balanced out by three and a half years of schooling i suppose although one of my friends at church who i do not see anymore thought religion was stupid and my mother and i think he could have been autistic i keep in sparse contact with one friend from my christianhood and none of the good friends i made in public schooland yet after all of my research into nutrition and other lifestyle changes such as aerobic fitness what could be the because of my low mood any supplements you guys would recommend as i am also taking boron which is a unessential mineral that boosts testosterone a fair amount among other thingsthanks for reading this long post what could be causing my suicidal ideation \\xa0suicide is painless my head is killing me'"
