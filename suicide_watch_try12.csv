Post,Ideation
might fuck around and kill myself,1
Life is the procrastination of death and I am planning on taking action.,1
"Every night I contemplate suicide and every time I think about how my parents would feel. I don’t want them to be sad or guilty but there’s no way I can kill myself without that happening. Recently, I’ve been slowly caring less about how they would feel. Idk I feel like I’m living on a timer that’s very close to ending soon, I just don’t know when.",1
I hate that I’m living for other people,1
"I hate my circumstances. I really don't see how I'm to continue. I haven't caught a break in a decade. One tragedy to the next. This world is unbelievably harsh. I feel crazy, like I'm living in the age of dinosaurs trying not to get eaten.",1

"I need to kill myself. This summer, June 29. I have my method planned out and I’m about to write my note. When you think about it, I’m not really killing myself. We all die at some point, it’s inevitable. It’s certain. So, who are to say when we can die “naturally”? If you know what I mean? All I would actually be doing is speeding up a process that will happen either way. I’ll just get it over with. Death is always at the finish line, we will all die no matter what we do. So why not die just a couple of years earlier than “planned”? Death is death no matter how it happens, “suicide” and “natural death” is literally the same thing executed in different ways.",1
"I'm a junkie who watched the love of my life commit suicide, and I’m 16.",1

"I plan on killing myself as soon as a I get my degree. I already fucked up my life permanently and nothing will ever fix it. I already donated all my money $200,000 to my sister. Luckily she hasn't told my parents yet.",1
"i’ve been thinking about killing my self for more than five years now, i’ve tried last week but stopped myself. i wanna die but at the same time i don’t, but i wanna have a failed suicide attempt so i can bring attention of how much i’m hurting, i feel guilty for wanting this but i wanna know if anyone else has had this idea or thought i guess.",1

A few moments ago I just came the closest I've come to suicide in years.,1
"Is it possible to be seriously considering suicide but just not be sad? Most of the time I don't feel sad, I just feel numb. I have been thinking about suicide, I'm trying to get help but it's hard to be open with therapists about these suicidal thoughts knowing they have the power to put me in the hospital. I don't think I need to be there, I don't know what that would even accomplish because I don't think there's anything wrong. I just don't want to live. I feel weak, other people are in actual pain and I can understand why they would want to die. I don't know why I want to die, I just do. I don't have a good reason. I'm not sure if I should take this seriously or what.",1
I want to die,1
I suffer so much pain I just want to end it all but the process of dying sounds to painful in cutting your wrist or taking sleep pills cause your body shut downs I just want this pain to end,1
"want to end it but seem to be still lacking the courage and the most optimum way to end my life. I'm a useless slab of mass nearing its expiry date. It's pointless, I'm not adding any value to the society. Shooting yourself seems a bad option to me bc I don't want to live with a deformed face if I survive.Sorry mom if this is the last you hear of me....",1
I feel so relieved thinking about suicide,1
"I have this nice feeling of closure when I think about killing myself, it makes me feel so good that I’d finally be in a peaceful state and not have to worry about anyone or anything, and it just feels so calming to think about.",1
I think about suicide nearly every single day lol I just wish I can be happy but my brain doesn't lol. I don't know I really don't...,1
"I can't fight it, anymore. my head is exploding, all my pain is screaming at me and it's just too much to take. nothing is going to help me, nothing ever did. I don't even know what to think of myself....",1
I feel like cutting myself and have no one to talk to,1

Why can't I stop believing in someone who doesn't love me for what I am? (I'm pan and questioning my gender) Especially when he supposedly made me this way? I'm so tired of my religious family saying that I can control how I feel. If it was that fucking easy, I would have done it! It's like they think that I want this.

I tried to kill myself tonight. I snuck out of my house with a length of rope. Not terribly thick but thick enough to do the job. This is the first time I’ve ever tried this. I used a slip knot around my neck. It should tighten as more weight is applied. Perfect. I used a double figure eight not around the branch of the tree. A good reliable climbing not. It seems to be ready. I placed the rope around my neck and stepped off the embankment. The branch snapped and I fell down the hell. I scuffed up my hands and cut my leg but nothing worse then that. I lay there feeling the cold wild and the blood on my leg. The rope still around my neck. I was not strong enough to try again. To finish the job. To find a branch that would do it properly. I went home and cleaned myself up. I left the rope in the basement. I lay in bed now and think about this shit. I just want to escape from this shit. I am to afraid to die. I don’t know what to do.,1

"I wish I was dead. I hate the uncertainty that is my life. I grasp for air and none is given. Im alone and waiting for the mistakes to finally hit me. I guess saying work is my happy place right now would be quite unorthodox, but it's the bitter truth. When I'm home I'm with a man who is supposed to love me. He doesn't. He won't even get intimate with me anymore. Despite not knowing where to go if we break up, I genuinely just want him to love me and to fix the fault in our relationship. It rips me apart but I must keep clear to myself that if a else fails the comfort in dying is always there for me.",1
My life is truly just one large tragedy and sometimes I feel like suicide is the only real way out,1
"I got into a car accident a few years ago and I wish I had just died. Being in the hospital was nice because it felt like time stopped. All I had to do was sit there and get better and isn’t death kinda similar?

"Lately, I’m thinking about ending things. I’ve been couch surfing for 2 months and I’m about to be officially homeless. Supposed to be starting work next week and honestly not sure if I’m gonna make it until then. I have tried once before and I was nearly successful...my dog kept me alive.

The process of doing counselling, medication, psychiatrists and exercise literally don’t seem to be working. I also have BPD so I always take up hobbies that interest me and help me stay sane for a day or two then I’m back to feeling numb.

"the day I was born was a sad day. I don't understand what went wrong, why couldn't i just be happy like everyone my age. I'm 16, but i'm already so tired of life. My whole life has been a living hell and i'm just done enduring the torture. I wish i got to experience the happy childhood my peers did. I have no plan or hope for the future. I want to disappear from existence.",1

"I am planning to jump from a height. I need tips on how to do it effectively, so as not to survive. I’m not sure this is allowed here, but I’m gonna do it regardless. I just want help so I don’t suffer more than necessary",1
The feeling of almost dying is crushing me tonight. Do I have to endure this void and pain because of other people? It was so close but I was just too dumb and didnt pay attention to the hours so I couldnt hide before passing out. Fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me I'll never feel the same peace again,1

I don't understand why my suicidal thoughts have accelerated so much,1
"I am 20 years old. I've been dating my girlfriend for over a year, but my mother only found out about it at the beginning of this year. My father accidentally saw me fucking my girlfriend and told my mother about it. They didn't talk to me for a few days. A week later he hung himself because I'm gay. My mother keeps telling me that I'm the reason he killed himself. I can't believe I killed him. I want to hang myself next week. I'd love any advice you can give me.",1
"I would rather kill myself on the spot then spend a second talking to someone like a therapist, and everyone who thinks therapy helps or helped them are lying, brainwashed or never really had a mental illness.",1
My wife cheated on me. We have 2 kids together. My kids are the only reason I'm alive. How can life be so cruel. From the day I was born I've been overcoming the worst circumstances and they keep getting worse. My kids are the only reason I keep going.,0
"i don’t care to create one either. there’s no inherent purpose to life. i used to read philosophy. absurdism. existentialism. nietzche. i found it interesting some of my beliefs had been written. but at the same time, i know i just have no reason to live. i’m tired.",1
I feel absolutely nothing. Yeah I’m completely emotionally void. And idk what to do about it other than want to die. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 so there’s that. Like I wanna cry but I can’t either,1
I wanna die  But I keep living  Why ? Why ?,1
convince me to kill myself. i’m high and this sub is insanely depressing lol some people are better off and i am one of them but a pussy. if you want to actually help me this is much better than getting generic advise or being told to accept a fast food gig for my whole life. feel free 2 comment and disagree and collect your karma lol. be thankful all of your brains work. dying sounds really nice since being awake and existing is making me feel genuinely sick now,1
I get really angry. I hate this world and all the people who act the same. I'm extremely angry everyday because it feels like I'm the only one that trys to think different from the rest of these sheep. I want to die because I'm surrounded by all these people.,1
"i plan to suicide tomorrow. i have been struggling to live ever since i have cronic back pain, i cant even work, even thought im very disciplin and responsible, its been 3 years since i depress everyday crying everyday, i have been trting to suicide for so many time but i scared leaving my love ones, but now im prepared, im ready tomorow i will do it,",1
"I don’t know what I need to do. I’m so lost , so lost . I don’t know who I am anymore neither do I care about anything which is happening around me , I’m being too needy of my boyfriend because although I have friends I find him to be my go to person and it’s getting too much for him too cause he’s facing his own issues . I don’t know what I should do , where I should go and with all this time and no motivation whatsoever to do anything I just don’t know any longer . I’m showing people my state cause at this point I can’t even hide it and it kills me to know that family around me is getting to know I’m not okay . I wanna be the old me again but I don’t even know her or anything now . Lost .",1
"I can't take the pain anymore. It's so hard to explain what the pain feels like to someone, but it's extremely unbearable, not even the fucking alcohol that used to help helps now. Nothing helps. The worst of it all is that I know damn well it's all my fault. Just 24 hours back everything was fine, not great or whatever, but I was keeping it together. I then became acting like a jealous piece of shit and now I just fucking it up more and more. I just can't stand this anymore, I want it to stop forever, I want to rest finally.",1
"Hopefully they don’t find my body. Bye.
",1
"It won't be tonight, or next week, or the week after, but I've long feared my life ends in suicide.",1
my life is falling apart and I'm out of options except for suicide,1
I’m feeling really depressed and lonely and really could use a friend to talk to. I feel like sobbing and hurting myself. I’m contemplating suicide and hanging myself. I’m thinking of trying it from a pulley system. Thanks. Goodbye if I don’t get back in time.,1

"Struggling with staying stable emotionally and getting a job, going to eventually kill myself if nothing changes.",1
"This may sound strange, but I'm not sure if I'm trying to kill myself. Like, I have multiple plans, just tried to hamg myself to know if it would be to painful... But I don't know it that counts as actively trying to kill myself. I've been 4 months clean for self harm, and I just wanna do it so bad. I just don't know if I should call the suicide hotline or just keeo trying to hang myself",1
"Hey, I’ve been doing some thinking and I come to the conclusion that I want to die, but I don’t want to do it alone. Does anyone else wanna die too?",1
When I was 11-12 years old I took a big knife and cut my neck big cut to sadly I lived and I’ve now tried to kill myself 21 times and it’s always on my mind mainly recently I found an old “journal” of mine basically just suicide notes but now I deal with a big scar and a fucked up voice I needed this off my chest thanks for listening,1
What amount of suicidal thoughts are normal,1
I probably will kill myself. I have depression with psychotic symptoms and autism with mentally abusive parents but humor helps me hide my pain lmfaaoooooooooooo,1
"I am going to end it all. I tried to move out today (18) and it failed. now my life is going to be eternally fucked and ive lost my boyfriend, of which i planned on marrying, because he stood up to my mother. I cant take my mistakes anymore. All of it was my fault, and Im going to take my last college exam and then take these pills. I threw away everything because im fucked in the head and i cant do this anymore. id rather end it now then my parents see my further descent, and honestly screw living anyway havent wanted to do this shit since i was fucking 7. im done on this earth, fuck you all, i never deserved to live.",1
"I feel like it's time to end my life soon...I tried so hard to get excepted by anyone, but for several years I have been alone... I feel like... I have already failed most of my life... I got rejected all the time and finding friends seems Impossible... It even got worse since I can't get any school stuff done since the pandemic... It's pure hell... I need to apply for a job but I got denied so often that I forgot to count I just want to end it all... I just want to be free from all the loneliness and pain in my life... The last time I smiled was years ago, the last time I saw someone I can consider a friend was years ago... I want to die now",1
"’m in middle school atm and wanna kill myself because of stress and homework and social pressure but I can’t because my best friend I’ve known my whole life would be upset, what should I do?",1
"Depression (diagnosed) but I’m starting to think it’s bipolar. Every depressive episode, it gets really really bad. I always get so close to ending it all it’s a miracle I’m not dead. But I will die. Every time I’m low, it’s a miracle I don’t try to end it all. I’ve just been lucky I was in places in which I couldn’t do it (school, public, etc).This disease WILL kill me. It’ll hit when I’m somewhere I can end it. It’s guaranteed. It’s fucking terminal. I’ll never escape this cycle. I will die. I’m gonna fucking die.",1
"i keep fighting and i don’t know what for. i’m miserable and i have no friends, my family hates me, and i love someone who broke up with me almost a year ago. i’m tired of existing but i’m too big of a pussy to kill myself. i constantly wish i would get cancer or get hir by a car because i want to die but i’m too scared to mess up killing myself and to keep living. my family constantly shuts me down and they don’t give a fuck about me, and i’m in a relationship but in love with my ex. i’m a terrible person who fails everything and i don’t deserve to live anymore.",1
i hate it all so much i hate myself i can’t trust myself i hate it all i don’t know what to do i deserve nothing i need to sleep and never akeup,1
"Really feel like killing myself today. Guess I'll have to go get a BJ somewhere, really seems to be the only reason to stick around. Otherwise life seems pretty awful and pathetic.",1
"I’ve discovered I have permanent brain damage from sleep deprivation. They’re notable, I have brain fog 24/7, I have trouble with word recall and memory. What’s the best way to kill myself? I’ve decided that’s what I’m going to do. I have no future because I’m stupid now. I’m tired of dealing with pain every second of every day. I’m tired of being miserable. I don’t want to live, I want a 100% chance of death, I dont want to survive with a disability of any sort after a failed attempt.",1
"For the first time in a long time, I actually cried. I'm just so fucking overwhelmed by everything. I have an important exam tomorrow and I barely studied for it at all. Fuck. I'm gonna fucking fail. Why do I have to always put everything off ""for later"" and then never do it? Why does nothing I try to do ever work out? I was trying to be somewhat positive today. And now I'm having a full on mental breakdown. Fuck this. I hate myself.",1
And nothing had gotten better. I am too much of a pussy to do anything about it and it sucks I hate it. I wish something could just kill me so my loved ones could blame that instead of themselves,1
"So, I've decided to kill myself sometime this week. Probably tommorow or the next day.",1
Tried to choke myself again and almost passed out,1
What are the fastest & least painful ways people have killed themselves in history when they weren’t of age to buy an gun?,1
"I am done.. ending life is my only option. its been 5 years since i am suffering from severe depression.... i have tried different doctors... different meds.. different dosages.. different therapists..tried to take steps like exercise n desciplined life, good diet.. prayers but absolutely nothing has every worked..my career is spoilt too. i am in the same spot where i was... Now m done.. i am starting to feel to suicide...",1
"i wish i had the courage to kill myself. life is just painful. i don’t know why i don’t do it. even when i’m presented with the opportunity, i don’t, and don’t know why. the only thing i want to experience is love, i just can’t see myself getting there. i don’t care about the family i leave behind. they all hate me anyways. my brother tells me every day to kill myself, and that nobody would miss me, and he certainly wouldn’t. i’ve just given up. it’s almost my time to go.",1
"i feel like im mourning my death.i havent died yet but i feel like im mourning it. like everything i do i think ""oh someone will think of this time and be sad because it'll be one of our last conversations"" even though it never is. stuff like that. everything i do is so distant and nostalgic because im just waiting for my death. im so miserable i feel like im grieving my death. i want to stop",1
"i want kill myself. sike, you are loved",1
whats the easiest way to end your life:),1
I just hate living everyday. I want to kill myself so bad. I wish my life life would end.,1
"I have no reason for living, my two closest friends left me like within two months of each other and now are so close I have to seen them weekly or more. I just do nothing right. Everybody hates me and I can’t fix it. I’d be so much easier if I was dead",1
I wish i had a gun and a hollow point round. It would be so quick and easy. Edit: a hollow point round is a bullet thats tip is hollow and it has ridges so its designed to break apart and expand on impact making it amazing for suicide,1
Goodbye. Seriously cannot take it anymore brain hurts too much,1
"If suicide was a button i would have pressed it long time ago. The title says it all, i don’t want to live any longer but i don’t want to commit suicide either. Im scared if i keep like this someday ill take the courage and just end it all.",1
"Im doing it. Finally. I have everything ready. I'm a bit scared. I'll jump, I hope it works.",1
"It's a long time since I posted something, I can't say that I'm suicidal rn, but I feel my anxiety is on the clouds, I don't like to live like this, you know what I really want rn? Someone to talk to, someone who hugs me tight. I want to talk to someone, about anime, about music about my dreams, is there someone out there who wants to share with me? I feel so down when I think about it, I don't want to die by suicide I just simply don't want to think on it.",1
Just want to die and need someone to vent to.,1
I have a pretty good life and yet I want to die. Is there something wrong with me? am I sick? What the fuck.,1
"Having a very hard time. Never easy to live when you haven’t a desire or reason. So many things are so wrong and I’m so damn tired. Please, someone, please pray for me.",1
"It sucks to die alone. As if killing yourself wasn't depressing enough, doing it alone makes it a lot worse. Is there anyone who wants to do it together? Plan together and hopefully not die alone?",1
Im tired with life. Im tired of everyone blaming me even though it's not my fault. Im tired of keeping everything to myself and cry myself to bed. Im tired that everyone keeps on telling me that what i've been through is not as worse as them. I did not asked to be born in this world. I did not asked to be in this life. I want the pain to be gone or at least more bearable. I just wanna rest. For a long time. I just want everything to end.,1
Whats the easiest and least painful way to die? I hope its possible to do when sleeping.,1
"reddit is horrible and every time i express an opinion i get hate for it, last time i posted here people downvoted my post to hell. no matter what i do this place is toxic and makes me want to shoot myself in the heart and die",1
"I feel like I’m truly worthless, If someone doesn’t have use of me I don’t think anyone would care if I’m gone. I find myself also caring more than others and feeling like this on my own I wouldn’t let someone go through this but i allow myself to. My sadness is not normal anymore it feels like crippling grief long story short I feel like killing myself and dying because I really don’t matter and at the end people will forget because no one ever remembers me.",1
I would simply like to die,1
"Relatively painless suicide methods? I’m set on doing it now. I have nothing to live for, no support network, no friends at all. I just don’t want to be in too much pain for it. I don’t have a gun or a car.",1
Suicidal ideation. I'm disintegrating... This is really bad… I'm refusing to live in la la land!! Basically I'm breaking away from narcissism but also there is someone stalking me that is also narcissistic. It's very hard to go cold turkey. If you knew addiction you know narcissism is more addictive than heroine. I've never done heroin but most of my relationships have been fantastical. I'm 26 just trying to get my ... Idea of life ... Realistic. Help or give advice. I think I have PTSD or cptsd,1
I'm tired of living. I just cant handle life anymore it's all breaking apart I have nobody to talk about this I'm feeling sick I hurt myself a lot and I don't know how I should go on,1
"Theres so much i want to talk about with friends and family but i cant. I cant get the words out, i cant find the appropriate time, they dont hear me when i speak anyway. Why dont you hear me when im projecting myself as best i can. I dont just want to die i want to never be found",1
"Life's been so damn hard, I'm broken, hurt, numb and empty. I'm so fuckin tired",1
"I look at myself and wanna panic and throw up, I shouldnt be here. this body moves and thats horrifying, a woven system controlled by my brain, always working to cut off that control. Im terrified of myself, I can’t stay inside of here much longer",1
"I just took 2,200 mg of Zoloft and 750mg of Mirtazapine. Am I expected to die?",1
I want to die because of online classes,1
"I completely ruined my only friendship He's blocked me in most places online He was supportive and caring most of the time I ruined this so badly, it can't be fixed, so I'm going to die planning to on my birthday! I'm a horrible person anyway. No loss to the world. I hope my ex friend will have a good life in the future :)",1
"I’m an 18 year old female. I ruin everything. I’m rude to people who just want to help me because I’m just always filled up with anger. Happy moments in my life (going on vacation last summer, prom, my 18th birthday a few weeks ago) we’re all terrible because I was just sad for no reason. It feels like nothing is worth it and all I do is let everyone down. I have no motivation to do anything after high school. I just want to die.",1
"Bye I’ll be dead when you read this, wish me luck...",1
I can’t take it. I’m a stitched pile of flesh barely capable of existing. All I can think of is clawing myself to pieces and tearing skin and tendons apart. My thoughts consist almost entirely of cleaving my hands off or scraping my eye out of its socket. My dreams involve vomiting ribs and intestines and all I want to do is buy a gun to finish the job. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror without losing focus. I can’t be around my friends anymore because I’m constantly reminded how scrapped together I am. Death would be a mercy.,1
"less than 2 hours before I make the jump. everything i did today has been my last, and my heart is beating so fast. only on the verge of death do i feel like life has meaning. its no one fault but mine. im ready. thank you.",1
"I just want to die, I've been suicidal since I was 8 and idrk how I pulled thru my family says I'm selfish, well I wish I was selfish for once and end this shit they call life, the only reason I'm still here is because of my cousin and little sisters, also the promise I made so long ago, WHY DID SHE LEAVE ME? THEN SHE TELLS ME NOT TO THE SAME, ne gayzzzzzz i have been clear for about 2 months, but rlly am thinking of it again",1
"Two idiots had sex years ago, and I have to live in this fucking world and suffer every single day until I die? And for what? Why did they even do this? Because of some stupid whim, they brought me to this world, and I'm supposed to be THANKFUL that they did so??? The only reason I'm still here is that I'm too scared to kill myself (I hate physical pain, even after living with it every day thanks to some fucking chronic illnesses). I can't forgive my parents for bringing me to life. Such a selfish thing to do",1
I really wanna shoot myself. If I tell anyone about my suicidal thoughts they’ll just send me back to a psychiatric hospital. So I have to bottle them up. Or they’ll just send me somewhere that won’t even help me. And my parents think killing yourself is selfish and they don’t understand depression at all. I just want to die.,1
"Really. I have no reason at all to be alive. My parents just argue 24/7, im completlly failing school. I lost all my friends. I have clinical depression. I need advice. Should i kill myself?",1
"I still wanna die, but I'm learning to keep it to myself again. Nobody wants to hear it, they all got their own shit going on. It's easier to just shove it all down again. I'm finding new ways to. It gets easier every day, and I feel less human every day. I guess it's not at all sustainable. But whatever...right now it's all I have.",1
I want to die. It’s too suffocating to keep living. I just want to feel nothing cause all I do is cry. I’ve already done treatment and I’m telling you it didn’t work for me. I’m not meant to be happy I can’t wait for death to come. Please someone manifest a nice death for me so I don’t have to do it myself.,1
"I've always had a love for death since I was younger, and the concept of death comforts me. The idea of suicide seems ""cute"" and appealing to me. Am I fucked up for liking photos of people's suicide and wanting it to be me? Either way, I really want to commit suicide. I have it planned out completely, including a route. I know there are many people that love me, but I don't care. I don't care about anything.",1
I attempted suicide on Saturday but before then I made sure to delete all social media apps and also all my pictures on my phone besides school notes. My school notes are just pictures because I don’t have the motivation to write shit down. I made sure to save them and they were saved but now 2 DAYS LATER THEYRE GONE?! Is this what I fucking get for trying to kill myself? Now I’m still alive in this bullshit and I will fail the school year now. Thanks universe,1
I just wanna be dead,1
"It's my birthday today, and I want to die more than ever.",1
"No reason to live. Life is meaningless. No one cares, I have no one. I've always been treated like dirt so I kind of expected this. No matter how much I care about others, it's never reciprocated. I'll be setting another suicide date soon probably. I don't feel pain at the idea like I used to, it's just natural and kind of funny in my case. I think it would be hilarious to die",1
I'm thinking of ending my life soon.,1
"Hello! I think about suicide,because i have credits and debts. I just need someone,who can loan me money. Its real in this worl or i just need to do it?",1
"My life is over. I failed at the simplest dye recipe for my dyer profession projects and everyone hates me for being ugly, I'm ending it all tonight
",1
"I am suicidal, I have been for almost the past year and I’m planning on doing it in a couple months. I’ve gotten pretty good at hiding my depression lately but I just sort of wish I could talk to someone about it. I have all these thoughts going around in my mind and i kind of just want to vent them all to someone but it’s hard because I know if I tell anyone they will try to make me get help or try to stop me from doing it.",1
No matter how hard I try I fail. People get advantage from me. I don’t do anything right. I want to get killed as soon as possible. I won’t be able to do anything right.,1
i think i might kill myself tonight. i’m just tired of this feeling i want it to end this is horrible,1
I want out. I really don't like any of this. Fuck my life. Let me out please.,1
"I'm just tired. This is the only place where I feel like I can say anything and no one can judge me, so here I go. I'm planning to kill myself  tonight, I'm just waiting for my parents to go to bed.",1
Someone please kill me. I don’t want to be here any longer.,1
I always fuck things up I'm just killing myself I can't ever do anything right I'm done fucking done. I'm weird I don't deserve to live I make people uncomfortable I'm just done goodbye.,1
i will neck myself. I can't take it anymore I tired of living where the only people care about is some fucking grades and about how I look bullshit that does not matter always being judge for playing video games my parents take things that make me happy in hopes of me changing people treat like shit then cry when you kill yourself I have been mentally broken to the point its all I remember its got to the point where i snapped at school said just wanted to kill myself and some bitch laughed and stood up walked to desk pushed her out of her seat grabbed that bitches hair slammed her head on the floor over and over I kicked her again and again the teacher could not stop me at that point because I was so pissed off i would attack her as well i was suspended when i came back she started her shit again when i was going back home i kicked harder and slammed harder when i was done i told her that if I had to do that again i would stab her until i killed her then she stopped my parents put me in a mental hospital i still want to kill myself i have spite for everybody around me,1
Making sure I kill myself tonight. I got everything I need right now it’s just a matter of time,1
Feeling so suicidal.I dont know how much more i can fight it im so broken.,1
"I want to take my own life, if someone could tell me a way that i could do it that is quick and if possible painless i'll be verey gratefull. Someone please help me find a way to go in peace",1
"I want to kill myself everyday, but I am afraid I will never have the courage to do it and will be doomed to live in this abomination of a body for the rest of my life.

I kinda wish my family didn't love me so I could kill myself in peace.,1
"I find myself googling ""I just want to kill myself"" pretty much every day.",1
"I bet if I killed myself in my apartment, I could easily go about a month before anyone realized",1
"My wife committed suicide, i want to follow her",1
Whenever things get shitty I just think about killing myself and it makes me feel better.,1
It’s pissing me off that I can’t have a conversation with anyone about suicide without them thinking I’m going to immediately kill myself.,1
i regret not having attempted to kill myself when i had the chance. i feel so trapped now. i really don’t know what to do anymore.,1
"I have no one to live for ..and i cant live for myself; the only thing I want is to die

",1
I think the only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact I do not like pain. I just wanna peacefully disappear in my sleep. Or get randomly abducted by aliens. I don't want people to remember who they think i am. I just wanna vanish without a trace. I've fucked up so much already.,1
I wish I was allowed to commit suicide.,1
I wish I fucking die in my sleep. I fucked up everything. I ruin everything I touch,1
"I cannot believe how undeniably hard it is to kill yourself. I've tried with guns and hanging multiple times throughout my life and I'm amazed how I can never go through with it. Even with every reason to do so, the fear and regret of the action is powerful. I guess I'm mostly afraid of living after the gunshot. Horrible agonizing pain. Still being alive. Possible vegetable status. And then my gun taken away from me which means I can never try again. It saddens me. I wish there was a legal, painless, peaceful way to go out that didn't require jumping over many hoops for many years to get to.",1
No nigga I literally want to kill myself but I’m too pussy and don’t want it to hurt,1
"The thought of killing myself gives me comfort. Knowing that I won’t be here for much longer. That it’s a matter of if not when I commit suicide. The fact that when it’s done I won’t be in pain anymore. Knowing that there’s nothing on the other side to worry about, no negativity, no pain, nothing. All of it comforts me. I can’t wait to die. I think about killing myself everyday. Hopefully it won’t be that much longer.",1
Inm writing this as I die. Just took alot of pills. I'm so sorry to my family that I wasn't strong enough. I'm sorry to my fiance that I could make it till the wedding. I send most of my money to my mother and fold my work I will not be. Coming in tomorrow. I'm fell like im might ye at peace. May god forgive me. Think I will use a knife to finish.,1
I lost my best friend. She told me she can't take my depression. Like I ask for this. Fuck her. Im over trying to open myself up to people and then stepping on me. When I kill myself they will all be sorry. At least I would be at peace. Fuck people.,1
Can anyone spare time to talk? I know its a long shot but I have NOBODY to talk to and no friends and I just need to get a few things off my mind that's driving me crazy. I attempted suicide and almost succeeded a week ago and I feel so helpless and weak as a person :( ive always felt this way but the last 6 months have been a lot worse Thank you!,1
"The only time I can get away from being depressed and suicidal is when I'm sleeping. I just wish I could sleep forever. Being awake, existing, thinking, remembering, eating. It just brings me agony. I was supposed to kill myself today, but I couldn't go through with it. I'm in so much pain right now",1
"I tried to hang myself yesterday. I deleted everything in my mobile and laptop.i wrote a note. But when I wanted to hang myself,I couldn't. I feel empty. In the days my thoughts are fucked up. In the nights I'm getting fucked up nightmares. Whenever I wake up I'm automatically feeling the need to kill myself. Yesterday it got real. The strings of all the thoughts when I put the rope on neck,I just couldn't. I'm worried about my mom and my dogs. But I just can't continue living this life. Wish I could get a gun, so that it'll all go away in a bang. I have no one. I'm afraid of the future. Only way I could escape this miserable life is death. Never realized how hard it is once I put the rope around my neck.i fucked my career. I fucked up life. At this point everything seems pointless.",1
"I attempted suicide last night. I drank one bottle of vodka and took 20 pills of valproate. I told my parents and they made me throw up the pills. I feel like such a failure. I shouldn't have told them. I was going to drink more alcohol and go to sleep hoping I'd get respiratory failure and then die. I was also going to take all my benzos but my father hides them because of another suicide attempt I had a few years ago. I feel helpless, hopeless, empty, lonely. I really wish I'd never wake up again.",1
I hate how conflicted I feel. On one hand I wanna just take my life and on the other hand I feel anxious to because I don’t wanna hurt everyone in my life. But the trauma of how I was emotionally and physically abused as a child just keeps coming up and the PTSD from it hurts so bad I just feel like I’ll never escape. I just wanna end it so bad but don’t wanna hurt my very little friends I have left... but my brain hurts so bad and I just want it to stop.,1
"I’m 13 and I got into an argument with my parents, after my mom punished me I went upstairs and whispered that I was just going to end up like my friend who committed suicide this year, my mom heard and she at first thought that I was just making threats, I explained to her my problems and she went outside, she was calling my doctor with tears in her eyes, I love my mom to death and I feel terrible for making her feel this way. I don’t want her to cry, I really don’t. What do I do?",1
"Girlfriend of 4 years (my first and only) just broke up with me because I'm too depressed. Thanks, that helped a lot. Now I want to kill myself more than ever and can't do it because otherwise she'll feel guilty and she doesn't deserve it. She's a good person. The best I've ever met. I am the one who's fucked up. Why was I even born into this hell. Also mt brother killed himself during our relationship. At least I had him before. Don't know if I can hold it for too long.",1
I am so incredibly sad and depressed I just don't see another way out then jumping off a ledge to be honest. I didn't want to die but now I want it more than anything. I feel like a shit human being because they only thing I can do is make people tired of me because my constant sadness. I just want someone to see me and my problems and just help me...,1
"I need advice: a friend just told me he is going to kill himself today. We met and try to talk so I can understand him. But i couldn't help, I tried to offer him a session with a specialist, and he denied it. He is really set on the idea, I've tried to talk about all the good things, but he doesn't care. I left him taking a cab to his apartment where he wants to die.",1
Life has and will always suck. I cant wait to die so why wait? Its constant pain...not even pain its agony its pain that i can't describe its too much and when i say too much i truly mean it. I don't have access to a gun but i have a few razor blades if anyone has any better idea please tell me. I hope i go to hell because thats where low life lazy people like me go.,1
"what is the fastest painless way to die please ik you will say ""dont do it"" or smthg but im fr in a rush help",1
"I wanted to at least clean my room and write few suicide notes but do i even care anymore. I'll just do it, silently, and stop suffering",1
I don't wanna die but i feel like there's no other options,1
"i want to rest. i don't understand how people can live and survive without ever thinking of suicide. what is it about life that they enjoy so much? are they happy? or do they simply not think about whether they're happy? yesterday my mom cried in my arms and begged me not to kill myself. i wanted to promise her that i wouldn't, but i couldn't. i just want to be gone. to stop thinking. to stop existing. to rest.",1
what r good ways of suiciding dont write helpful shit,1
I wanna end it today My best friend killed herself a few months ago and I haven’t been the same. I’m always sad and I just don’t see any better days coming anymore. This is my 5th suicide Iv had to go through and I’m only 22. I’m tired of all the hurt I go through and all the loneliness. I’m exhausted,1
"All I want is a hole in a wall somewhere. I don't want an apartment, or house, or anything. I want a hole in a wall and a secret room so I can come and go at night (or really any time). I don't want to be seen. I want to be invisible. I don't want anyone to know my name. I want it to be like I was never alive. I want everyone to forget I was ever alive before I die. I want everyone to hate me. I fucking hate everyone. The only practical way to kill everyone in the world is to kill one self. I hate the idea that after I die anyone else will still be living.",1
"My GPA is terrible and I want to kill myself Long story short, I calculated my GPA, calculated what it would be if I did well next year, and it's a fucking 3.0. I'm in sophomore year of high school right now and the pandemic started when I was in freshman year and after that my grades dropped so much that at some point I was failing everything. I really thought I'd turned things around and gotten my grades up but apparently the damage is irreversible. I looked it up and even if I do well on the SATs and ACTs I won't get into any good colleges. I'm a failure. Both my parents and my older sister and pretty much every adult relative on my dad's side went to amazing colleges and I'll probably be the only one to go to community college. I hate myself. I'm probably going to go to a bridge and jump off. I already tried overdosing a while ago and I didn't even take enough to throw up.",1
"Life isn't fair I'm tired of feeling powerless, I've got such a lack of control of everything around me that I find it too overwhelming. I just need to accept the fact that I'm worthless and insignificant. I'll never have any power, I'll never be completely satisfied with my life and the way things are. Death would be a sweet release to escape the overwhelming and harsh realities of life. It's not for me anymore.",1
"Looking at everything wondering how you could use it to kill yourself is so tiring. Anyone else get this? No matter if its a building, a lake, whatever. Its so tiring and frustrating.",1
"I tried killing myself but failed. I stopped taking care of myself. Being a teenage girl sucks. Ive stopped exercising, doing my homework, seeing my friends and doing other things I liked. I barely shower and I stopped tracking my period. Daddy doesn't care about me, no one does. I feel worthless and stuck.",1
"I want to end it, but I am not allowed to I want to die. Simple as that. But I cant die knowing I will destroy my family with my death. But I cant live without my partner either. I just want to follow her into the grave. She took her own life, so why shouldnt I? But i cant do to my family what she did to me... God... i want to die... but I want live too. On the contrary, I feel like I am forced to live.",1
"I wanna kill myself My aunt died, my dad just got diagnosed with cancer, and my mom found out I'm failing my classes. ",1
I don't know If I can do another year. Today is my 25th but I don't know if I have any have what it takes to go another year. I've been fighting my demons and trauma for over 15 years and I don't think I can keep it up. I just wanna go to sleep forever. It hurts to keeps fighting.,1
"I wish to end my life today because I'm in a constant depression and loneliness, i keep having panic attacks and i have no loved ones to reach out other than my mom, my other family members hates me for no reason, i don't know what to do at this point… I keep praying to God than getting a panic attack because of it , I'm in a constant torture",1
Only thing I fear is not being able to successfully kill myself I accept that my life is shit and probably is not going to get better (Physical health issues) as long as I can die.,1
"I keep delaying my death, but… ...not because I wanna keep living, I'm just afraid of death. I didn't put all that commitment in nothing just because I thought ""I will die anyway. One day I'll have the courage to kill myself and everything else won't matter anymore"". Just... I totally don't have the courage to do so. I hate my life but I'm too scared to die. I pray my sufferings will end but nobody seems to care.",1
I'm alone I'm scared and I feel so so bad. Could someone say something please. It doesn't matter what I just need something to feel real. I know this isn't a helpline I dont know if I could bear saying this out loud. I just need a connection to feel something other than this please,1
"i am so lonely. i think of committing suicide everyday. i’ve never felt this lonely in my life. this pandemic has shown me that i truly have no real friends and it’s killing me inside. it’s like i knew it before but this is just confirming it. being lonely is one of the worst feelings in the world. not only that but i am so worthless. i don’t do anything with my life. i’m only 18, i should have friends and experience many things right now but i have nothing. absolutely nothing. i keep crying myself to sleep because there’s no one there for me. why can’t i just die? i don’t have a purpose and i’m sure no one would care. i’m just so tired. i’m sorry",1
I'm thinking of ending it all,1
My girlfriend left me i cant bare the pain my head is in pain I have ocd I keep having unwanted thoughts about her ther is this pain in my chest and head I cannot distract myself I'm broke I cant do anything idk I want to kill myself I cant take it anymore plz idk what to do idk what I should do,1
"I'm just tired. I ain't suicidal, depressed or bored, either. Mostly tired. Tired of waking up, everything. Tired of living.",1
i hate everything literally. it's almost like i can't feel anything but hate towards everything. life's crap. can i finally kill myself successfully?,1
"I‘m thinking about ending it a lot, but I‘m too much of a coward to actually do it. A painless instant death right now? Hell yes I would do it. If I had an easy accessible way for cowards with 100% success rate, bet me in.. I don‘t see a reason to be alive, there is no happy future I see myself in, nothing I want, no kids, house, wife, success in my job. Like nothing, I don‘t want to see the world, beautiful things which may be beautiful to others? I see it, I see a sunset, but I just cant feel it. I could say „wow, what a beautiful sunset“ - I‘m unable to believe my own words. But I know life is a gift and valuable treasure - but I don’t want it? I didn’t ask to be here? I‘m not made for this shit.",1
"I simply deserve death! It's all my fault. I'm just an useless bad cringe edgy ""depressed"" kid! My bullies are right! I don't have friends,all I do is listen to hatsune miku and watch stupid japanese cartoons! No wonder why no one likes me! I'm just a weirdo! WHY CAN'T I JUST BE NORMAL FOR ONCE?! If I harm myself,it's still my fault! If I end my life,IT'S STILL MY FAULT! NO ONE WILL EVER CARE ABOUT ME. I BET THAT IF I WOULD DIE,THEY WOULD MOCK MY DEATH AND SAY THAT I WAS SOME DANGEROUS INSANE PSYCHO WHO SHOULD BE LOCKED UP! I CAN NEVER ESCAPE THIS HELL. I WILL NEVER,NEVER NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY DID AND SAID",1
"I want to die but I don't want to commit suicide I hate myself.I want to die.ut I don't have my favorite character in a game yet. And my mother is nice. I know she would be sad if I die.I don't want pain, either. Jumping off from a bridge, wrist-cutting, putting a rope around my neck.... sounds like it hurts. I have ADHD, can't focus on stuff. I get bad grades and I might fail. I go to a private school, and my family has to pay a lot, and my parents aren't rich. My father's job might not go well. Whenever I speak out my problems to anyone they always get sick of me talking because I have too much negative energy and they are feeling bad, so I can't say anything. I am an introvert and people always has to talk to me first before I speak up. And my voice is very small and people can't hear it well. ""Then don't die"" If it was that easy, I won't suffer....I just want to be gone from this worldlike pressing a button and disappearing. I'm tired.... ",1
"I feel really hopeless. I haven’t been happy in such a long time. And it’s getting to a point where I don’t even know what I’m continuing to fight for. I feel so lost and useless like I don’t have any purpose. I’ve tried so many times to find things that make me happy or bring me happiness but I just can’t do it. I can’t seem to actually find any true happiness. Any time I’m happy it seems to just be temporary. Everyday I wake up and immediately want nothing more than to just go back to sleep. I’m in a loop of just sleeping every single day as much as I can because any time I’m awake I’m hurting. I really can’t do this anymore, I’m so tired of fighting to be alive everyday.",1
I just don't want to keep going I hate my life,1
"My life is boring, might as well just kill myself and be reborned into a more fruitful one",1
I want to die asap I mean that's all it is. I have nothing in this world and it just hurts so much and I don't want help I just want to leave. I'm going to try tonight. nothing even matters when your dead anyway that's what I always think. It all ends one day and nothing matters in life so who cares when u die,1
i fucking got a fucking plan i might not do it today tomorrow or even this fucking year but what im going to do is ask my crush out she will say no then i can fucking kill myself with out felling like i fucked up anything,1
"I cancelled my suicide plan. I was talking to my online bestfriend and she somehow convinced me to not die, I mean now I don't want to die, but I hope my mind doesn't get changed few days later :)",0
"I will never have the courage to kill myself. If I wasn't such a sniveling, worthless coward, I would have made something of my life. If I had the tiniest bit of anything that makes any person worthy of existence, I would have something. I am a useless eater. I am a fat, worthless, lazy, stupid, undeserving piece of human garbage. I am shit in a thin skin. Any honest human being, seeing what I truly am would agree that I should kill myself immediately. But I never will, I am a piece of shit. The right people never kill themselves. And the wrong ones do. If you actually have the compassion and courage to go through with it, you should not. I wish I was good enough a person to drive everyone away and kill myself. I won't because I am a cowardly piece of shit.",0
"Walked out to a bridge but didn’t have the strength to end it. I’m suffering and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried everything, the hotlines are worthless. I just want this to stop. I hate myself so much. I’m out of options and I regret walking away from the bridge. I just feel worse now.",1
If I didn’t have 2 younger sisters i wouldve been killed my fucking self,0
i wish i could sleep for an eternity i don’t want to die but i don’t want to live if it means living like this. i don’t want to cry anymore. i don’t wanna hurt anymore. i just wanna get out. there’s no way out of this,1
"Sorry, just posting to get it out there. Everytime I've tried to off myself I've felt happy on the last day. Today is the happy day, it's rare I'm this happy or excited so hopefully it's the last time, hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow.",1
Is it an intrusive thought if I am having suicidal ideation /imagery thoughts of myself dead via a certain method? I am finding it very distressing I don't feel at risk at the moment but idk… I find the thoughts really confronting and idk why they have started up again,1
"A really bad dream made me suicidal again Today I had a really bad dream, the content being about taking my own life. I feel so bad right now I don't think I can face my parents. I just needed to vent, it's pretty late and I don't think anyone is awake right now.",1
Feeling suicidal I know my mother and friends want me to tell them about my feelings but I can't. I'm feeling really inadequate right now. I have a root canal and discovered I have jaw bone loss. Then I have to get my braces to correct my open bite. I have approached obesity for the first time in my short ass life. I also am very stressed from having to pay an extra year for college along with potential dental bills. Im constantly trying to diagnose myself with health issues. Recently I've noticed my stutter got worse along with my tinnitus. I just had these intrusive thoughts to OD on ibuprofen. I only had one. I got these pills for my root canal I failed to take care of. I don't know what to do. I'm just thinking I'll feel much better if I were gone. I hate feeling sorry for myself and my conditions.,1
"I'm sorry, but I can't keep doing this. I'm sorry best friend, but I can't keep doing this. I've been depressed for such a long time and I'm tired. I'm so tired. I'm so fucking tired. I'm tired of being dysphoric. I'm tired of being disassociated each and every day of my entire fucking life. May 6th is the date I told you. May 6th is the date I wrote in my phone. that's the date I deleted from my phone after you cheered me up some that day last week. May 6th is the date I reset in my head even though I didn't reput it in my phone. May 6th is the date. It never fully left my mind. I know you said to tell my therapist, but I don't think I have the courage to tell my therapist I picked a date. maybe I don't want to be stopped. I know I'm going to break your heart when I do it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you always.",1
"She deleted her accounts, she told me she found another person that’s why she broke up with me  I’m crying so hard, all the things. All the things I’m been through and she just ends our friendship and relationship telling me that she found another guy. I hate myself I’m crying. I was going to meet her.",1
"I'm a failure and just want my life to be over. I (22m) am just sick of being alive. I'm a worthless high school dropout with no friends or any kind of future. I feel like I would be saving a lot of air if I hung myself tomorrow. The only thing stopping me now is my parents, my suicide would ruin them. Yet my life weights heavier on me with each passing day, this brutal soul erosion has become unbearable. I have a job helping the mentally disabled, it's fulfilling but the pay is a pittance, I'll never earn enough to start a family or be a viable partner for anyone. I've never been romantically intimate with anyone, nor do I think I ever will. It feels like I'm missing out on a vital component of the human experience. I'm a failure, a looser by anyone's estimation. I just want this to be over",1
"I attempted suicide Saturday night. And no one knows. I took a bunch of sleeping pills with all the alcohol from my two day bender, went to bed and hoped I wouldn't wake up. But then I did. I don't know how to talk to anyone about what happened. I don't want to say the words to anyone for fear of making it more real. I mean how do you say to your friends and family that you tried to kill yourself without them even noticing? How will they trust me again?",1
I’d rather have a terminal illness At least then I know when I will die. No one gives a rats ass about suicide unless they want to not feel guilty,1
"If I had a nickel every time I had told someone on here that I was depressed and they called me a “troll” I would literally be a billionaire. I’ve said it many times. Nobody actually cares about you, they just pretend",1
"I think im going to die soon anyway... I'm not feeling well.. I'm always running out of breath.. My head is swimming and always hurts.. Like if for one second I stop focusing I will pass out and thats it.. I am not well.. I have no money, no family, no love, no hope, no clean clothes, cant shave or shower.. Yet everyone keeps saying I need to live or I have so much to live for.. Then why wont you help me!? Please kill me.. Or help me? I cant live like this anymore.. Please kill me.",1
"6 months since my last suicide attempt. Everything just got worse honestly. I wish I could give my life to anyone else. I try to practice gratitude, but I feel like no matter how much good I do I end up back here. I can’t even remember the last time I ate. I’m constantly confused as to whether something actually happened or not. I’m getting nowhere in therapy. I can’t afford my bills. I am such a waste of a person.",1
I don’t have a reason to keep going. I don’t want to be me anymore. I can’t even write out a long thing about how miserable I am. I’m just so tired. I can’t do this anymore. I’m sorry.,1
I recently had a failed suicide attempt. I don't think I can live with the shame I scared the people who care about me. I even scared myself. I was doing insane doses of benzos and don't remember much about what happened. It was very spontaneous and I wasn't lucid and sober at all when I did this. I think I fried my brain or something. I don't feel like myself anymore... Now I've made a huge mess and just want to dig myself down in a hole. The guilt and shame is unreal. I don't think I can recover and take back my life after this. I'm really scared now..,1
"Most painless method? Been looking for a way out for quite some time, nothing is going ok in my life and it’s been this way for years, looking for a painless method as I have a low pain tolerance [im still a kid so I can’t just go to the pharmacy and buy anything]",1
So I overdosed and I feel calm. I’m just waiting til death takes me. I’m a bit sad that I’ll have to die alone but it’s okay. At least soon I’ll be free...,1
"My close relative has just hung himself. I have no words. I’m devastated. He was my age, only a year older (19 years old). It hurts so much. I am SICK by the fact that parents do not pay attention to the pain of their children at all. Teenagers are super, super vulnerable. They only see it when it's too late. I’m furious, as a person who has had suicidal attempts herself. And after that, people will say that mental disorders DON’T mean anything? I have lived with borderline personality disorder and complex PTSD all my conscious life. I've had suicide attempts. And now I'm sobbing, and understand: I DON'T WANT to be one of those people. No matter how difficult and painful it is. I don't want to leave this world so early. Through all my pain, I try to see at least some rays of light in this world. Sometimes I lose my faith. I feel his pain very strongly. To everyone who’s currently reading this: Please don't leave this world. Please move on. Your pain matters. Ask for help. Whoever you are, I love you, and you are important.  ",1
I think I’m ready I’m getting drunk and I’ve just been sitting here looking at my gun and I think it’s finally time. I’m gonna finish this bottle then get through with this shit life.,1

"I’m having a really hard time in life and I can’t stop fantasizing about killing myself. I attempted suicide in the past through overdose.... it didn’t kill me rather caused neurological damage that impaired the motor skills in my hands. I had to reteach myself how to do everything with my hands. I had moved past all of that and was trying to pick up the pieces and learn to appreciate being alive. My mental health started improving, I got a good job, picked out a healthy partner. My life should be great right now. Then last July my grandmother who was my best friend fell and hit her head. She was resuscitated despite her DNI and spent two days as a total vegetable before dying. Right after this I also had an onset of a chronic pain condition. Before my sickness started I was already dealing with pain from my endometriosis and the adhesions binding my organs. For the last 9 months I’ve been seeing doctors and no one has helped me. I stay between 8-10 on the pain scale all day long every day ( and all night since it keeps me up). After almost a year nonstop pain it doesn’t matter how much therapy or support I have.......... I just want out of this pain and I can’t stop obsessively thinking about how to do it properly with no errors as I know firsthand what it’s like to fuck up a suicide attempt and be left damaged. At this point the fear of waking up in the hospital in even more pain is what keeps me from killing myself by a thin hair. But every day I get closer to the edge. My family and therapist see this. They are trying so hard to help me. I am trying so hard to help myself. Nothing is working and I am in pure agony both mental and especially physical. I feel as if I was born to suffer. I survived a very traumatic childhood, years of abuse, and severe mental illness to be struck down with genetic diseases before the age of 21. I feel pathetic and like I’m dying inside in a way I’ve never experienced before.",1
I am going to finally do it. It's almost time. When everyone goes to bed. I have a bunch of tylenol waiting for me. I am terrified. Hopefully it's not too painful. It will all be over soon .. Goodbye,1
I just want to end the pain and laid to rest at this point. I'm sick of the crying and panic attacks. I never asked to be born. I fucked over my parents life since they became parents so young. I want to die but I'm to scared to do it.,1
"I wrote a suicide note and idk why The other night I went to bed pretty early and I randomly woke up at 4am and started getting such intrusive thoughts of what I would say if I ever committed suicide and left a note. Right then and there I got my journal and I wrote out my note. Before doing that and getting that random thought I didn’t consider myself suicidal but I’m not so sure now. The things that popped into my mind just seemed so justified to me and made suicide actually sound like an option. I don’t have any actual suicide plans but I do know what I would say in a note and I know how I would do it, and those thoughts alone terrify me.",1
"i don’t mean any form of encouragement by this at all, i was just manic and i am now inherently worried. I took 6 500mg paracetamol tablets and 2 200mg ibuprofen tablets.... anyone have an idea on how dangerous this is? do i need to throw up ? help please",1

But at least I’m leaving with something I accomplished, I can’t and won’t imagine to keep living with this stupid depression anymore.

"Thinking about it. Already a few pills in. I've toyed with the thought of suicide for a while, and now is the perfect time seeing as my parents left for vacation and nobody will be around to stop me. I'm taking vicodin and xanax, feel pretty good rn and am still with it, but I have all these pills in front of me, so tempting to take them all and just end it. My future is hopeless, lost my job back in April of 2020 which was the best job I'd ever had, and it threw me into a deep depression. Ended up calling a suicide hotline (big mistake) and was involuntarily committed to a psych unit, and made to take meds that my insurance didn't cover, I still owe around $1000 for the bottle of Latuda, which is a shit drug and I wish I could sell to someone and help pay for it. I'm putting in hundreds of applications a week, but no luck, and my unemployment is out. I'm probably gonna swallow all these pills. My love interest isn't texting back much anymore, probably found someone else. Nobody will ever love me for me, and if I keep on living I'll just be a miserable wage slave that's given up on any form of a dream. Peace out yall, if you hear from me in the morning so be it, but if I don't wake up I guess that's that.",1
"They just keep trying to make me do it. ""You're gonna kill yourself? Ok. Whatever. No, you aren't, it's not that bad."" I'd ask ""wheres a razor blade? I wanna kill myself"" and they say ""check the draw under the sink. It should be there."" They push me down the stairs and my head into the walls. I'm not allowed to get treatment. They watch me try to kill myself, give me things I'm deathly allergic to to snort so I can die, they just bought me a new razor blade/box opener for it. They put me in triggering (PTSD and ED's) situations and never allow me to have my coping mechanisms. I tried to kill myself. I do every day. I did 10 minutes ago. I wanted it to work, but we couldn't find that goddamn fucking razor blade that we all searched for 30 minutes ago. The kitchen knife was too dull.In the morning it'll be ""See, you aren't dead. Fake bitch. I wish I had gotten that abortion.""Yeah. I wish you did too.",1
"I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts daily for nearly 6 years now. Therapy doesn’t help. Everyone in my life is temporary. I keep becoming more of a fuck up day by day. No matter how hard I try, I always fuck up. I am a waste of oxygen. I haven’t killed myself yet, but I’ve already decided it is my fate. Suicide is how I am going to die. It won’t be illness, old age, or a car accident, it will be from a cocktail of drugs and alcohol and a bullet to the brain. Nothing will change my fucking mind.",1

I had a good thing going with an angel of a woman, I fucked that up because of my selfishness. I am bipolar, I am never happy, I can't do this anymore. There's nothing left for me. I'll finish my art and end it. I'm tired of this, why can't I enjoy anything? Why am I always so ungrateful for everything. I have family and friends that love me but I feel so alone. I don't deserve their love. I wish I was a fucking ghost.",1
I dont care about the pain anymore i used to fear the pain that would come when i would kill myself. it always led me to stop. i dont care if it hurts. i can endure a couple hours before i end it. i just want permission to end it. im horrible and awful and terrible.,1

They have now made be take 2 of my current depression pills (not serotonin one) and I feel the same. (which is complete shit)",1
"I feel so tired. I come from an abusive household, mentally and physically. My entire life I’ve done everything I can to leave their house and start a better one of my own. I’ve coped with chronic anxiety and depression while making my way through school and got accepted into a college only to find out I needed one more class to transfer causing a possible effect of my acceptance. There’s a lot of filler to this story but I’ve dealt with so much stuff and I’m so tired I feel exhausted. I haven’t gotten suicidal thoughts in a long time and I don’t know why but I feel done. I felt like I was just finally able to be free and happy but even if I do go to college Im starting to believe that that’s something I’m never going to feel.",1

Does anyone else just wish they could purposely fail a suicide attempt just to get people to care and hear you for once? It seems like nobody truly gives a shit until you kill yourself or try to kill yourself. Fuck.,1
"I spend more time planning my death, than my life I find it hilarious, in a fucked up way. I just don't want to be here, making plans for the future. I mixed 2 chill pills and I'm already yawning like mofo. When I'm ready I will take more",1

Happy that I would never have to endure another day, happy because I would no longer feel pain nor sadness... I was about to die and I was so happy about it. But someone found me, did what they had to do and I survived. I don't think about killing myself as often as I used to but I miss the feeling of overdose. It genuinely felt amazing. No, I won't tell you what drugs I used.",1

"I think I will end my life this week. I've been dealing with depression for the past year and a half. My parents don't take it seriously and I just feel so alone. Please don't say that I am loved and that people care about me. Nobody has ever cared about me. I promise. I'm invisible. I talk and everyone just ignores me like I'm not there. My feelings are never important or valid to anyone else. My “ mother “ is mentally and has been physically abusive toward me before. And all my parents do is complain about what I'm doing wrong and complain that I'm not like my sister. I'm not 18 so it's not like I could just move out. I've always had this lame plan to graduate high school and then leave off to college, legally change my name, and never talk to my parents again. However, waiting another year to graduate is not a part of my plans anymore. I'm tired and exhausted. I wish I could explain how tired I am. Mentally and physically. I don't remember what it feels like to be happy anymore. At this point, I don't even know if I believe in happiness. Anyways, I plan on killing myself this week. Today was a really bad day for me and I almost ended it all today. i didn’t go through with it however I wrote my suicide note today. I'm not sure if I'll leave it behind once I go. I might just leave with no explanation. Some things are better left unsaid. If you read this whole thing thank you, and goodbye.",1

I am so sick of it.And most of all I am so sick of myself and of me being alone and unable to help myself.",1
"Isn't it lovely to be such a failure To have no job or Future whatsoever. To be too scared to speak your mind to anyone as your like falls apart. To not be able to speak like a basic fucking human. To feel distant from everyone and wanting more but too scared lazy and dumb to do anything about it. To be only known for playing videogames, not well but playing them. To wish you died in middle school because that was the last time you felt joy without anything in the way to ruin it. ISNT IT FUCKING LOVELY!",1

I’m in so much debt, i’m doing so shit, i’m not going to get a job in my field even if i get this degree.

But not because of my circumstances, problems, looks, money etc. I’ve lived a pretty normal life, I’ve had good relationships, friends, and experiences but life is draining. I can push through a deal with life’s problems and come out of the end okay - but what then? Life just feels like a never ending cycle of draining experiences. I’m only 22 and I feel like I have already experienced everything I’ve wanted out of life - I don’t desire more money, relationships, friends etc and I’m slowly losing motivation to chase those things. I just want the experience of non experience - is that so bad? The more I continue to live life the more it just fatigues me - the idea of not having the capacity to experience things just seems attractive. I will probably do it soon and I don’t see a reason why I shouldn’t.",1
Wanted to buy SN to kill myself but I need more planning to avoid getting found I just wanna die already and it seems like I’ll have to delay my plan by like 2-3 weeks if I do SN.

Recently I have been watching my life like from tunnel, or like in a movie.. watching everybody else living, just watching. I have been even thinking that this might not be real, maybe I'm not longer alive.. I don't see my self as a living entity anymore.. am I a thing? I got so tired to feel pain, to fight for happiness.. now I do t feel anything... even when my heart is broken, I feel... empty...",1
I hate everything about myself and have been considering ending it for a while now. Highschool is just about to finish and I don't even know if I'm going to graduate.

Here are the highlights, I'm a fat, worthless piece of shit who can't do anything right. I don't have many friends, most of them are sick of me now. Chronic pain keeps me from making more. All I've ever wanted out of life was a serious, loving relationship. First serious girlfriend cheated for months. My life has been one long bad joke. Someone find the right words to say. Please.

"I’m passively suicidal. I tried once, it didn’t work out and not sure I’ll ever be willing to try again. But I still want to die. I live like someone about to kill themselves. I’m unemployed so I don’t work. I don’t socialize. I don’t really have hobbies. Just YouTube, porn, eating, and self-hate. It’s scary how deep this hole has gotten, and don’t see a way out, and since I won’t commit suicide, this hole is going to get worse and worse. But that isn’t enough for me. I still don’t try. It’s too painful. I wish I’d died last time.",1
I’m tired of being sad. I’m tired of being depressed. I’m tired of suffering. I’m tired of being alone. I just want to rest with no more pain. Tonight I almost tried hanging myself with a noose. I couldn’t even tie it correctly from the videos I’ve seen so I just gave up on it for tonight. ,1
"Having suicidal thoughts in public is the worst feeling i ever had in my life My chest hurts, i think I'm about to faint or something.

"Help, I'm having unwanted suicidal thoughts.. I'm 17, and I'm not entirely sure if I have depression, but I feel like I've been the most worthless and undeserving piece of shit ever. I have an okay life, with loving parents, siblings, and cute dogs. Lately, I feel so tired and lethargic, and so miserable like an intense heavy feeling in my heart, and it's already been going for 5 straight months already. I found myself crying more and more frequently. I don't have any problems, I have a few IRL friends, and I'm sure they'd be heartbroken if I decide to kick the bucket. But I just can't help but feel so worthless. Everyday is so boring and monotonous, even when my family and I went to a spontaneous trip. I'm supposed to feel happy at that, but I wasn't. I feel like I'm not doing my best, I feel like I've been disappointing others, I feel so shameful... As I grew older, my view in life went from an exciting thing to a miserable existence. I don't feel like doing my responsibilities anymore, I don't shower anymore, I don't exercise anymore, but somehow, I overeat, and my once skinny frame became more pulpy/chubby. I don't have anything to look into and anticipate in my life, I feel so hopeless. Hobbies, video games, entertainment became so bland to me, too. My thoughts then turned into how I can try to kill myself, just in case... I just searched how to tie a noose, and I tried it on jumping ropes, and it worked really well on my wrist, it turned my hand purple for a moment. I figured I don't want to go down this path. My thoughts will get worse and worse for sure, but I really really don't want that to happen! Please, any advice, I appreciate it.",1
"I want to die because I'm too ugly. I can't tell anyone about it because they'll just think that I'm vain or seeking attention, but I'm REALLY suffering because of my appearance every single day. The first and last thing I think about every single day is how much I hate my face. It doesn't help either that I'm surrounded by gorgeous people all the time. All I do is cry everyday in my bed feeling like the ugliest person in the world. Therapy and medication didn't do anything so I just want to disappear already.",1

"Idk if anyone else feels the way I feel. I just want to be forgotten about. I want people to just leave me behind and go on with their own lives. I stopped going to my friends and family when things aren't good (which is all the time.) Nobody will just let me die and that is what I want so bad. People don't understand what I and the rest of you go through. Death is the only way out. I have one of my best friends trying to convince to do inpatient at a hospital. Did that once before and it didn't work. I hated every moment of it. They left me in the room by myself, a psychiatrist came and talked to me but it was half assed. I hated it. I just want to die and no one will let me",1
I’m lost. I’m twenty years old and feel as if I wasn’t meant for this life. Everyone around me has goals and dreams and I am just drowning in a lack of direction and hope. Everything feels pointless. Part of me feels like life is worth living and I shouldn’t give up while the other wants to give up once and for all. I am alone.,1
"I have tried to get help by telling my family as i live at home, but they responded by shaming me and all that did was accelerate and amplify the suicidal thoughts. I fought back tho and have been on the verge of suicide for about two mounths now. I just want help before I cant wait any longer.",1
"I really wanna die! I don't wanna live, pls help.",1
"I want someone to kill me. I can’t kill myself. Because oh, no, that would be selfish. I have so much to live for, no reason to be depressed. So I want someone to kill me. I’ll be a tragic murder victim instead.",1
"Suicide is the only thing on earth that gets rid of all problems thoughts and feelings forever. Suicide is just way too good to be true an end for everything sounds way too nice.I can't remember the last time I didn't think about suicide for a whole day, I just want peace for one day so I can remember the feeling.",1
"Absolutely love when I tell my doctor I'm feeling intensely suicidal, yet I refuse to get any treatment that I get thrown into a shitty ward with no blinds, stuck in a single room by myself and the bare minimum of personal freedom, I remember why I hate talking about how I feel, because I get locked away ?? fuck this awful system",1
"It always happens. People get tired of me talking about depression I know they hate having to ask ""how are you"" because the answer is almost always ""bad"". Then again I'm too stupid to keep answering it with ""bad"" when they only want to hear ""I'm good"". I tell my family that I'm depressed and they change the subject or sigh with annoyance. I don't have anyone to talk to and it's killing me inside. What's the point. I know they all would prefer me to succumb to my depression. Maybe then I'd stop bitching and moaning about how ""sad"" I am.",1
"The only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fear of messing up. Knowing me, like everything else in my life, I would probably fuck up. The last thing I need is the embarrassment of being in the hospital with permanent organ damage surrounded by family and friends I barely speak to anymore, all forced to pretend like they care about me and my stupid brain. I want it all to stop hurting.",1
i’m so suicidal and depressed that i fantasize about getting murdered. it’s quite disturbing to speak about it but i always make these scenarios of me getting killed because i’m too scared to commit suicide. i just want to be done with. i want it to be all over. is it just me? idk,1
"I think i should kill myself.. So iv’e been lying in bed a few hours now trying to think of reasons to keep going. I keep trying to convince myself the world isn’t a terrible place. Theres so much hatred between people, greed, and everything is about money. Im just ashamed to be a part of this self destructive human race. I don’t get why i would slave away at a shitty job for 50 years in a world with so much negativity in it just to die at the end of it. Why shouldnt i just kill myself now instead of wasting my time?",1
I will kill myself in less than 2 hours,1
"Suicide feels like my calling in life The same way people feel like they were born for their career choice (doctor, lawyer, musician, accountant, etc), I believe suicide is my ultimate purpose in life. I can’t think of anything else that would suit me or even make me happier than if my life were to end abruptly, preferably sooner rather than later. Suicide just feels like the perfect match for me",1
"Should I write a suicide note for my online friends, or should I just give out a vague reason on why they'll never see me again? I will be writing a suicide note for friends and family, but I'm not sure about online friends. My fear is that I'll survive my attempt, and then they'll think I was lying when I actually failed the attempt. (If somebody tells them I survived, or if I ever decide to talk to them again.)",1
"I'm no longer suicidal and it makes me feel worse. I've truly come to accept that I don't have the guts to commit suicide. But I don't feel better for it. I feel worse. Suicide always gave me comfort, an escape from all the problems in life. But now I have to deal with all this bullshit. On top of that, I wasted so many years being suicidal. It didn't matter that my grades were dropping, I had no job, no skills, no long term plan because I'm just gonna kill myself later. Well I didn't and now I'm suffering for it. Fuck my parents for bringing me into this world.",1
"I think I'm gonna do it There's no point in life for me. I have no friends, everyone hates me, I hate going to highschool, I don't even know my personality. I'm trying to be likeable and act like a normal person but it's hard, I feel awkward. People I know rejecting my friend requests on fb or not following me back on ig is what got me to this point, feeling hopeless and realizing no one actually cares about me.",1
"Since I'm no longer afraid of dying, I do wonder to myself what is stopping me from ending my life now? I do want to stay around with my family and friends for a month, but I am almost don't care to hold off much longer. That's the only bad thing about acceptance and feeling numb. I could end it all, at any time, even if I didn't intend to end prematurely.",1
I really want to stop existing but haven’t found the most effective way yet. I will be too ashamed to stay alive after a failed suicide attempt.,1
I tried to die but it didnt work Why is dying so hard All I got was a stomach ache that lasted for 7+ hours,1
"Goodbye Hey everybody, this is my last post. tonight I’m going to OD on sleeping pills. I hope I will have a better after life. goodbye.",1
"I am attempting suicide tomorrow night. I will tape a plastic bag over my head. It will take me about 10 minutes to pass out, and another 10 to die. I feel oddly calm right now. My heart is beating out of my chest with excitement though. Wish me luck. ",1
"i just wanna fuckin g die i can't even conversate well im so stressed out and so awful i hate my life so much i just wanna fucking die why won't it ever stop why is it fucking constant now im not even happy for like 4 hours only its just in the moment sometimes rarely and then im back to being fucking AWFUL. helphelphelphelphelphelphelphelphelphelphelphelpmakeitstopmakeitstopmakeitstop make it stop please fucking make it stop ill always be like this what the hell is wrong with me why am i liks this i just want it to stop whafs even the point when im not HAPPY. i want to be HAPPY for once is that too much to ask for, or maybe i just deserve this. actually this is probably some higher beings way of making me suffer for being a horrible person i fucking deserve this lol ",1
"I’m going to make my next suicide  attempt tonight I might wake up tomorrow, I might not. Edit: I woke up, but I’m not stopping",1
I want to die so bad right now Anyone got some good sad music to drift off to?,1
"Jumping off a bridge is not the way to go. So iv’e been lying in bed a few hours now trying to think of reasons to keep going. I keep trying to convince myself the world isn’t a terrible place.

it's so fucking hard to keep living when you're already dead.,1
My entire family is leaving for good in about an hour and a half and I just can’t wait to finally kill myself. I never wanted to hurt them. Never wanted to put them in a position to find my body. I’m going to play some music and drift off to the sweet sensation of carbon monoxide poisoning. I pray it works. The beyond has to be better than this.,1
"I’m 21 with nothing left to offer to this world. I’m ugly, I’m not interesting or smart enough to make up for the fact that I am ugly, I struggle with friendships and making new friends, I don’t have any ambitions in life whatsoever. I’m not meant to live a long, happy life.",1
"I constantly fantasize about my death It gets worse when it's a bad day of course, but even on ""ok"" days I feel like I'm better off gone. I'm sick of disappointing people and not living up to their expectations. I'm tired of it all..I dont wanna die by pills cause I heard it's very painful..I'm not sure on what I should say on my note either.",1
i turn 16 in 6 days . i dont know what to do because i thought id be dead by the time i turn 16 im so unprepared . ive been living the past couple of years under the assumption that nothing mattered because i have no future to prepare for . the closer it gets the more im afraid . im not ready to get older . 16 is such a big number . i still feel like that scared 9 year old .,1
"I’m probably going to end my life. I’m 15 male gay and a furry, I feel like the world hates me because I’m gay and a furry I get made fun of because I’m a furry and gay I seriously hate it I don’t know what to do anymore I feel like I should give up",1
I was turning left on a green arrow but someone ran the red and i almost hit them and i almost died. I wish i died.,1
I tried to kill myself in February. No one tells you how you’re supposed to feel after a suicide attempt. Lately I’ve been overwhelmed with the pressure to kill myself and I feel that today is the day,1
Been ghosted from a girl I was dating. I want to die.,1
"I consider this an attempt but others might not. A few days ago I attempted to take pills but I was too much of a pussy to do it. People talked me out of it and I wish they didn’t. I hate feeling this way, I know it’s an illness, but I just want to give up. Thanks for reading. I know I post on this sub a lot, I have just gone through a lot and I would like for it to end.",1
fed up of my life want to kill myself,1
I’m sad and thinking about my life. So lately I’ve been falling down the road failing 12th grade. And gotta repeat then I’m sad because I can’t go nowhere due to covid . Sometimes I’ve been wanting to kill myself because of my past as well and it makes me sad . I’ve been bullied since freshman and gotten beat up I am still scared from that day. And now I’m school I don’t know what to do ....,1
"i dont want to live hi everyone. im new to reddit so forgive me if i do anything wrong. i just want to vent real quick because i dont really have anyone or anywhere else to vent to. im depressed and i want to end it all. im only 14, but it feels like im only going downhill. im so tired and sad all the time. i think about ending my life every single day. i feel selfish. i have a roof over my head, food is always on the table, and my family is very supportive and caring towards me, which only makes me feel worse about my suicidal thoughts. i want to end my life so bad but at the same time i cant because i know it would make them sad. i just feel like theres nothing for me out there. i feel like my existence is meaningless and worthless. if i have it hard now, and its only going to get worse as i get older, whats the point of even trying? i dont want to live but i have to for my family. i hate it so much and i just want release but i cant and its so painful",1
"i hate myself for being such a disappointment Why am I not enough? My family is broke but they love me too much so they are currently supporting me financially through my ""gap year"" while I study for 15+ hrs a day just to get into college and I just feel lost at this point I've achieved nothing and I feel like I'm just wasting their money and time I physically am unable to be productive idk if it's because of my shit mental health but my circumstances are literally dragging me down and I dont know how to get out of this state My family cannot survive through another failure i cannot afford to fail and I am so scared because honestly I'm not sure if I'll make it sometimes i feel likenid rather die",1
Failed suicide attempt Wow so I’m still here came out of hospital and life’s gotten worse cuz I posted my problems on socials so everybody knows my business and keep pestering me like I’m pity case keep getting the same questions again and again but now I just feel bad cuz what I did hurt them and I’m just disgusted with myself but just hate being me and can’t do it again cuz I’ve got everyone checking up on me every 5mins like I’m gonna snap I’m not even getting treated normal they just feel bad for me and just treat me like somethings wrong with me,1
"I cant find courage to commit suicide even tho i am in pain I cant fight back against anymore. Pressure from society, family and loneliness broke me into pieces. I hate everything that defines me. I cant ask for a therapist or for a help cuz my family would refuse to take me there cuz in the place where i live society thinks that if u go to the therapist then u are s crazy mad person who must be locked up in asylum. I wanna commit suicide but i cant find courage to do it. There is nothing beautiful in my life.",1
"Intrusive Suicidal Thoughts. I have major depression for many years because of the shit happened in my life. Every time things happen I have this intrusive thoughts that I have to kill myself. Like there's a voice in my head keeps telling me I HAVE to do it. Sometimes I'm not even upset about anything, but the voice just keeps telling me that everybody will be happier if I do it. I have lost interest of things that I used to enjoy, my life doesn't have purpose anymore. I'm tired of this and I might do it eventually.",1
"I like feeling physical pain if the psycological goes away for some time. Imagine ending it all, all goes away.",1
"Getting comfortable with the prospect of death by suicide A few days ago when I posted here, I was on edge and crying about how I'm going to die early and miss out on things. Now I feel like I'm starting to accept that people (which will include myself) die :) Like I feel so numb and not afraid of death, and hopefully it will stay the way till the end of May. Any time I don't attempt/commit I end up regretting it.",1
"October of 2019, I attempted suicide. It was my third attempt. The first two failed, this third one I was caught. I spent some time in the hospital, and have been in treatment since then. It hasn't helped. Since I left the hospital I've lost my job, my car, my home, and all my friends. I've moved back west to live with family who abused me as a child. I dont know what to do. I think about killing myself every single day. It's the only thing that I can think of to make the pain stop. I cant even tell my therapist, because he'll just put me back in the hospital. And I can NOT go back to that nightmare.",1
i attempted suicide for the 6th time about a month ago and i legitimately cannot remember anything from the past month. i’ve been dissociating a lot. i can’t even pretend to be okay anymore. i can’t stop thinking about suicide. i wish it would have worked so bad. i feel like i wasn’t meant to be alive after that. i feel like i was so set on thinking that i would not be alive right now that nothing feels real anymore. i did everything fucking right. i did everything fucking right and i tried so hard and i still suffer. i’m sick of trying so fucking hard and getting nowhere and no one ever noticing how hard it is. i literally physically cannot do this anymore. i’m maxed out on zoloft. i started wellbutrin. they recommended antipsychotics. i don’t want to do it anymore. what did i do to deserve to suffer like this? everyone says it gets better. it fucking doesn’t. i want to kill myself.,1
I encouraged an aquatience to drive drunk because I was desperately hoping I would die in an accident I'm still alive and still nobody know about my suicidal ideation.,1
"It’s to the point where the only thing keeping me here is not to put my family through that. But as the days progress, even that hasn’t become too much of a worry. I’ll be dead, I won’t deal with it. I can only hope they understand why I made this decision.",1
"I've had three suicide attempts in five years abd I finally figured out what I did wrong. I've given life every chance to ""get better,"" but the truth is, sometimes, it doesn't. I've worked at it until there is nothing left of me. Money would help, but the amount I need now is unattainable. I learned from my mistakes. I made a real plan and I've followed it for over a year. The end is here. I with I felt relieved, but I really don't feel anything at all.",1
I’m scared of myself. I’m scared that sometimes I will act on my thoughts even when I don’t want to.,1
"I'm too much of a pussy I'm too afraid of what comes after death to even attempt suicide but i really just want to die. Why isnt it socially acceptable anyway, its my own life and i never wanted to start living so i should be allowed to end it anytime i want fuck this i cant talk anymore i just want to die",1
I don’t want anything in life. I have literally no goals or ambitions. I don’t care about anything. If money was no object I would just stay in bed. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to skip to the part where I don’t exist,1
I want to kill myself again My dad wouldn't give a fuck if I killed myself anyway I want to die I want to die no matter what I just want to die,1
Failing suicide lucky or unlucky? Im a very unlucky person and my biggest fear is to be unlucky and fail suicide.,1
I WANT TO DIE I get tricked into things and then I just can't escape and I end ruining people's life instead of helping because I'm a spineless coward,1
I think I’m gonna kill myself in a month Just found out something about my future and the chance of me ever being happy is close to zero. I’m just really great full to the people who made my life amazing for 7 good months,1
"I want my life to end somehow but I don't have the courage to commit suicide. I'm also afraid of the sadness and shame my parents and close family will have to suffer if I do it. Things happened in my life 3 years ago and they practically killed my soul. Now I'm just a body that simply exists. I'm jobless and unmarried. I pretty much stay inside home almost every day. I don't find any meaning to my life anymore. And it doesn't make any sense to me at all when people say that you are letting others win if you commit a suicide. I don't want to achieve anything anymore. And I don't have anymore wishes other than to leave this world asap. Any words of inspiration from anyone do not practically help me at all. Each and every day, I wish I had a cruel enemy who wanted to kill me so badly so that I don't have to commit suicide.",1
I know that in order to have a better life I have to leave my family. But i’m not ready to say goodbye to them. I feel like leaving will create bad blood between us and make things even worse. That’s why I want to just die.,1
"i feel so empty and alone i'm just struggling to stay happy at all. i've felt so empty and alone my whole life and it's killing me. there's so major reasons rn. read my last post on my account if you care anymore. i feel like i need someone but ion want them to tell me what to do

I‘m waiting for my loved ones to die As horrible as this sounds sometimes I‘m waiting for my loved ones to die. Normally I get rlly depressed when I see realize my parents are getting older bc that reminds me that one day they won‘t be around anymore but sometimes I‘m waiting for them to die so there is nobody left that would be hurt when I kill myself. I‘m waiting to be the last one alive so I‘ll have no feelings of guilt when I can finally do it,1
I should have pulled the trigger I really should have.,1
"I want to die, how???",1
I’m physically exhausted all the time I’m mentally tired and I can’t take it anymore I feel like my relationship is going to shit I want to constantly kill myself but I’m too much of a fucking pussy to do anything. I can’t talk to anyone about the way I feel because they either ignore me or get upset. I can’t fucking do anything right anymore I feel like a fucking failure,1

"I tried to hang myself yesterday. Tied a scarf to the top part of my door hinge that sticks out, climbed on a chair, tied the scarf round my neck, and stepped off. All I remember is about two seconds of, wow, this hurts, then I blacked out. Next thing I remember, was a bunch of voices talking and chattering, and suddenly I was awake, in a lot of pain, in the exact same position. I started crying instantly from shock, and managed to climb onto the chair - I still wanted to die but I couldn’t bare the pain. At first I thought this all happened in a few seconds, but when I checked my clock I found out it was actually at least five - seven minutes, which shocked me. I still have a massive mark on my neck from the scarf, and I’m convinced that I would’ve died if the knot had been a bit tighter.",1
"Thinking about suicide makes me feel calm/relaxed Everytime when im at work/home I think about ending it and it makes me calm that i dont have to worry about my future etc. In my free time i just lay in my bed making all these weird plans on how to end it. looking up good places where to do it etc. I work 60 hours or more a week. I earn good, own a house, car etc but everyone left me no friends no family. I am just here to work and die. Who would miss me when im gone I probally be replaced with another slave. Bye",1
"I'm deleting all my social media so I can focus on killing myself. I'm just tired of living for other people. That's all I've been doing. ""surviving"" for other people. And I'm tired. I'm making this post as my last resort. So I can be stopped. ",1
"Wrote my suicide letter. Have a rope around my neck. I am not sad. I didnt cry. There are no tears on the thin paper. Just the small writing everywhere and a dandelion I drew in one corner. There is no future for me. Being trans is so hard and I dont know who I am anymore. Its to hard to find out and being dead seems to be so peaceful. I did some shit in the past and said some wrong things. If there is hell, I will go there. I dont care. They cant do anything I havent already done to myself. It is probably better when I die.I am just a teenager. Soon a dead one.",1
My suicide note/ Well.. I don't feel there's much to live for.,1
My fiance just went on a long rant about how much he hates me and how worthless I am. How do I build up the courage to kill myself? I'm going to stop taking my pills starting tonight. That should makes things easier tomorrow.,1
"i am so happy and i want to kill myself my life is great. just two years ago i moved 3,000 miles to be with the love of my life after getting kicked out of my homophobic parent's house. everything that could've gone wrong, didn't. I'm so happy and I still just want to die.",1

No one is willing to hire me, and I have nothing in common with anyone. I can’t relax and listen to music or even listen to ambient noise, and I can’t make friends or stop hating people for long enough to ask them out.

From a pure non emotional perspective I have very little chance of happiness in my future, any happiness I could possibly have would only be found in the use of things like alcohol and cannabis, those are not good enough reasons to stay alive, I have no plans or things to look forward to, there's nothing that does now or ever will make me feel fulfilled in life, I honestly believe I'd be better off dead at this point and the only keeping my alive is my own cowardice, I shall simply have to work my way up to it.",1

And I read news articles and stuff like that about how people think I am a monster, or how entire countries or religions want me dead.

There's ain't no reason to live anymore. I couldn't be more isolated from others, I'm just feeling how time just hurts.

"I fucking hate myself.  I always feel so useless to everyone and I want to kill myself but I'm too scared to do it. Everytime I always talk to someone, I feel like I'm wasting their time. I've done a lot of things to cope with my depression: Talking with friends or family (but I'm too awkward to make a normal conversation). Getting high and/or drunk (even though I'm not at a legal age to do these yet). Relaxing playing video games or listening to music (I can barely enjoy doing these). I'm worthless, lazy, ugly, stupid, and with no real friends to talk to. I want it all to end but I'm either to exhausted to better myself, or too scared to kill myself. I feel constant hatred towards myself every second that I'm conscious. Someday that hatred might take over my timid nature so I can kill myself. I just want to be heard without my social anxiety take over. I like the feeling of being anonymous so I can vent without people knowing it's me.",1
idk what to feel. i feel pathetic cause every second of my life i wanna die. but when pain behind my eyes and the headaches started i couldn’t. i started panicking like a fucking idiot. the beginning felt good. i wanted to keep doing it and i felt like i’m finally gets g to go. but then i lost oxygen and i fucking started panicking. i just wish someone would just kill me for me.,1
I dont know if i can hang on My suicide is a couple months away yet. Im waiting for inheritance to come through so i can finalise my affairs and leave no financial burden on family. It will also allow me to donate a large amount to charity. I was supposed to use this for top surgery (im trans ftm) but its wasted as life just isnt for me. Problem is im struggling to hang on this long. I have everything I need to to die and ive become more reckless with self harm etc by the day. I have an addiction to codeine and I have been taking up to 40 tablets a day (codeine and acetaminophen) and i guess im hoping this will naturally kill me anyway. How can i hang on to do this the right way so at least my death will ease the burden rather than add more.,1
"I’ve tried my hardest but I lose in everything I try. I have a 3.9 GPA, I’m in shape. but still my career doesn’t want to hire me and women of my own ethnicity hate me. will probably commit suicide by 30 if I’m not a millionaire by then",1
"Over the last month or so it feels like everyone has forgotten I exist. My friends don’t call Anymore. An abrupt end to a relationship. My family doesn’t even wanna talk to me anymore. I feel isolated and forgotten by the world. I’ve been clean for a few weeks now but that will change tonight. I want to cut my face and neck so no one will ever want to talk to me again, so that this nightmare will be over. Maybe someone will care when I’m gone....",1
I’m scared if I start trying again and fail I will have the final push to go through with it. They say if you believe you will be a failure you probably will. I have had this mindset for so long and don’t believe I can change it and I do I’m afraid I will have the strength also to end it. Either way it’s a dead end. Try and die or die and die.,1
I can’t do this anymore. Ive been suffering for way too long. I tried to get help but everywhere I call it’s either too booked or my insurance does not accept it. Killing my self is the only way I could end all of my suffering.,1
"I'm tired of always feeling like I'm the absolute worse. Of feeling like it's going well, until it doesn't go well. This world is broken and so am I, and there's nothing I can do about it. I just wish I didn't look at figures of innocence with envy, because I hate looking at children and seeing the spark in their eyes, that is now long gone from mine. I'm still not gonna kill myself. This isn't hope, it's fear. I don't wanna do this to the people that I know love me. But part of me hopes one day I'll go batshit crazy and slit the fuck out of my wrists or take a shit ton of medication and die.",1
My impending divorce and subsequent bankruptcy has me wanting to kill myself.,1
"I might kill myself My mom caught me doing something worse than you could possibly imagine x 10. I was so close with her, now I can’t handle being alive with her thinking of me like that. I think I’m gonna kill myself.",1
"I want to disappear. Hi, lately I’ve been really dealing with self harm and suicidal thoughts. I feel like everyone I tell is annoyed by me by now and if I tell my therapist I might get sent somewhere. I just hate myself and my situations.. my life my past will I have a future? I’m honestly so close to just saying goodbye.",1
I really fucking hate everyone I hate me the most and I wish I could just fucking end,1
"I don’t want to exist, I don’t want to be in this body anymore, I don’t want to be gay, I don’t want to be a burden in everybody’s life anymore, I’m done with all of it. Everybody says that I’m great looking and that I’m just this great person, but I know none of it is fucking true. They just say it to make me feel good about myself. I’m not desirable in anyway shape or form and I’m just gonna end up dying alone, as I should. Maybe I should just fuck my whole life up with drugs or just killing myself. I don’t care at this point.",1
"The world would be such a better life without me. I’m tired of being fine for one moment then wanting to die the next. I know if I tried to do anything it would hurt my family. I feel like such a fucking burden, disappointment and useless. I may not be able to be saved but you guys can be. I’m sorry for being alive. I’m too much of a coward to try to kill myself again, I’m an awful person. I wish I could just sleep forever....",1
Should i just killllll myself now or just endure the slow painful humiliating process by continuing to sleep outside until they find my lifeless body behind this Michaels arts n crafts building,1

"I'm guessing suicidality always makes you feel like your situation is unique and hopeless, even if it isn't. So many people benefit from reaching out to others, getting professional help, medication, coping skills, habits, changing lifestyle, etc. I need someone to talk to.",1
I started drinking again too and now I feel really weak. Maybe I'll stop breathing in my sleep. Honestly I hope I do. I dont care to live a meaningless existence anymore.,1
gonna go crash my car into a tree as fast as i can i fucking hate everyone i cant take it anymore i cant wait to finally fucking die,1
Everyday my brain tells me I should overdose. The one person I love isn’t mine anymore and I vent to them too much to tell them how horribly I feel right now. I really want to kill myself tonight. My life feels like it’s falling apart. I want help but I am too depressed/scared to ask. I’m so exhausted from suffering alone.,1
"I feel like I've been on the border as far as wanting to kill myself goes. Every day is the same in terms of not wanting to exist, not enjoying things much more than 5 minutes at a time, having stress about usual things that most don't, and constantly thinking about waiting another month for my psychiatrist appointment. Improvement isn't guaranteed, but improvement is guaranteed to be slow. Will the pain my parents suffer be worth ditching my future suffering for? Haha",1
"HELP : Way of committing fake suicide I don’t completely want to die but I want to end it all. I have no hopes and live everyday full of shame, guilt and regrets. I never really prepared my future and I’m at a point where I might have completely ruined my life and can’t even hide it. I want to give myself half of a chance, I would genuinely appreciate it if you guys could share soft ways to end it all, that if anyone finds me then I’ll get help but if no one does, then I’ll still end up winning. Please.",1
"I’m quite literally tired of the struggle in life, it’s never going to end for me. I’m always crying have no hope at all, any hope I do have is FALSE. Have no one to talk to and the ones I do talk to have no understanding of my situation. I wish every night that I don’t wake up only to be mad I’m alive in the morning.Just useless existence.

But until now, I didn't get a job, and I'm struggling to build myself as a freelancer. I have so many regrets on my teenage years because I didn't have experience some fun. So, I keep on comparing myself to other people on their success, good social life, career growth, and relationship; and I'm not grateful because I always experience struggles. As I grow older, I always telling myself if I am still worthy, because I don't have anything to prove myself to people. I feel weird because most of the people who I interacted didn't like me. I don't have much stories to tell, I don't have such experience in life. I love being an introvert, but I like to interact with people, I just don't know how to handle it.

You can look at my other posts to see what I've gone through in the last year if you care to have the context. The TLDR is that I'm ""starting over"" my entire life and moving to a new city with no connections and no job prospects. I changed my name and got a new phone number. But I don't want to do any of it. I wish I had about a hundred Xanax I could down and just end it all. I've overdosed three times before and survived each time. God is telling me I should stay alive. I need to hold on and keep going. I'm taking steps to try and improve my life. I just hate myself so fucking much. I don't want to do any of it. I want it all to end. I'm tired of thinking. I'm tired of feeling. I'm heart broken. I hate my body. I hate my face. I hate my voice. I hate my personality. I hate my trauma. I hate my autism. I hate my mental illness. I have no joy in my life. The only temporary relief I have is when I'm binge eating or doing drugs, and then afterwards I feel like shit. I want to die. I can't keep holding on. None of this feels real.

Like life's not great right now but at this very moment it's not terrible either yet I've been fantasizing about overdosing for the last few days. It just seems so easy, I catch myself daydreaming about my own suicide all the time which sounds really bad. I won't do anything of course but it's always in the back of my mind, almost like a craving. I constantly have thoughts of suicide and its scary to say but they've gone from distressing to peaceful, I'm not even kidding when I say I think about my death and the aftermath while I'm falling asleep. My mental health has been deteriorating and sometimes it feels like suicide is a great option even when life isn't fucking me over.",1
"Is it wrong that I fantasize killing myself? Im between driving as fast as I can into a pole or tree, or shotgun to the roof of my mouth. Something I can’t fuck up. Whenever im depressed or dealing with anxiety thinking about suicide is the only thing that calms me. The only reason I haven’t done it yet is because I always try to find the light at the end of the tunnel. Lately there has been no light. Anytime I think I made a friend or gotten close to someone I’ve been stabbed in the back. Im 20 and still living with my parents. My parents were emotionally abusive when I was a child and are more like roommates now more than anything else. I have no friends. Im completely alone. If I get kicked out and become homeless it would be the final straw. I don’t have the energy to deal with this. Ill take the easy way out.",1

Or killing myself, jumping into the river in midnight and shit you prolly know. Do yall have these too and how do you feel after you wake up? Im feeling guilt and regret, i dont want to hurt anyone and id be ashamed to death if i hurt anyone.

"My mental health is holding on by a thread. I tore apart a razor blade and cut myself with the tiny blades today. it is not deep but it is bleeding like crazy. Im in university and I have depression, anxiety, ADHD and really unhealthy sleeping habits. Uni is so hard online and assignment deadlines are pressing. Things have become so much worse since things got online. I've never even been to my campus for a lecture, it's a shit show. I guess what Im asking is...how should I cope without slowly going insane?

A traumatic brain injury I had led to a mental disorder and my life won’t get better, matter fact it will get worse. I hate when people tell me that everything is gonna be alright like how the hell do you know?? I’m not being negative just realistic. Hate how society views suicide as egoistic act or coward, when the only egoistic people are those who tell you to not kill yourself just for the sake of your loving ones. Like I should keep suffering forever just to not make you suffer right? I don’t want to kill myself now but I already told my family I eventually will, even if they don’t take it very serious. I wish suicide were something quick and easy but without a gun it isn’t and I don’t really wanna hang, I guess this would be the ultimate solution. I read a lot of threads in this sub and most of y’all shouldn’t commit suicide, life is really great when you have all your mental faculties everything is possible, don’t give up friends",1

Then when you kill yourself everyone's like ""Oh I never would've thought, I wish he would've given some sort of sign."" I said how many times I want to kill myself and I think I might do it, but I know if I do people will act like it's a huge surprise. I've been serious all along. I have a rope tied into a noose in a box in my room, so that it's always ready. I'm not joking or just looking for attention when I tell people I need some kind of help. Everybody only pretends to care and then when you're dead tries to say they cared all along",1

I have this darkness that have imprinted upon me, and I can't seem to shake it. A sad soul, with a melancholy so profound it'll haunt me even after death if there's an afterlife. I never cry, despite the gnawing ache in my chest begging me to kill myself just to escape it. No matter the meds, therapy or any of my vices, the sadness stays.",1

"I won't kill myself right now, but I really want to die I was doing so well with my intrusive thoughts and handling my OCD, but it's come back almost full force. It has me feeling so hopeless. I don't want to live like this anymore.",1
"I’m going to Kill myself tonight. Hi everyone! Well tonight Is my last night here unfortunately. No one cares about me, all I do is cause problems. I tired reaching out just now but with no sim card I can’t text or call any crisis lines. And everyone around me right now laughed when I said I need to go the hospital. So this is it. Goodbye everyone. You know what’s the worst part about this? I don’t even want to Die but I feel like it’s the only thing to do. Thanks for listening. For anyone out there, check up on your people",1
Thinking about jumping off a bridge or throwing myself into traffic makes me feel so.. calm,1
"I've been suicidal so long I don't know how to be anything else. The smallest, stupidest things make me want to die. I want to die because I don't want to go to the grocery store, because I can't find my keys, because I've been avoiding talking to my family and now it's awkward. Because I'm not at all the person that I want to be, because I feel like I'm not much of a person at all. It's less a result of something and more of a reflex because that's the only way I know how to cope, at least if it gets too much I can die.",1
"I wish I was dead no one messages or cares about me, I'm bad at everything I do, I get nervous every time I go out in public, I cant socialize, I feel like such a failure, life is grey and feels meaningless at this point and there's nothing I can do about it.",1
Planning a painless suicide because of total irreversible anhedonia,1
"if this goes on for anh longer i wilk kill myself and absolutely nothing will fucking stop me id rather cut my arm off then do this anymore no amount of physical pain can match what this is, nothing csn ever fucking get worse. it is unbearable and i can't even cry about it",1
"i am going to kill myself, but i don’t want to ruin my mums life i am about to turn 18 and i have hated myself since i was 8. i’ve struggled through 10 years of suffocating depression and i am so tired, i am ready to die. i am not strong enough to come to terms with the sexual assault that happened to me and i hate myself and my body so much that sometimes i think that i should be lucky that it happened to me at all. i am beginning to think that my friends hate me even though they all tell me how much they love me, the only reason i haven’t ended my life is because i know it will ruin my mum and i don’t want to do that to her. there is nothing keeping my here, and if nothing has changed by my birthday in june i am going to die. i feel peaceful about this decision, the thought of living one more year feeling this way is unimaginable",1
"It's really weird when they talk about my future job or career or something and I just sit there, squirming and feeling awkward af because I just want to die really badly and don't want a future for myself. My only goal is to die or get murdered in the next 2 years and my parents think it's to become a police officer. I don't want to achieve anything, I don't want a job or go to college, I just want to end.",1
all i do is make everyone else uncomfortable because im sad all the time. people just pretend to care because they don't want to feel guilty or like a bad person if i actually kill myself. but it's all just for show. once im dead everyone will be glad that they're finally rid of me. no amount of therapy or medication will ever fix me. there's no point. im not living for anyone or anything. what's the fucking point,1
I wish people could see the pain I’m carrying. Pain just pain but I can never speak of it and what I plan,1
I really want to die. I am tired of everything. Suicide seems like blessing right now cause death will end all my sufferings and then i can rest,1
"I thought of ending it. I don’t think I ever will. Not as long as my mom is alive. It hurts so much. Just because I decide not to doesn’t mean I don’t want the pain to go away. I can barely stand it anymore. This morning I fantasized about a belt around my neck. But of course, I don’t want to inconvenience others. My back hurts. My ass hurts. My brain is tired. My heart hurts. My neck hurts. I am always confused. Work and school and so tough. I just want to die. I won’t... sorry if this is the wrong thread. I just really want to get away from all these obligations. Dying would be stupid.",1
I am 18 and I have tried to kill myself multiple times and I just want someone to talk to and maybe make some friends who went through the things I went through,1
I wanna kill myself Yeah that's the whole post,1
"My husband doesn't care that I want to die. That's it, I guess.",1
"I got suicidal thoughts for a long time now and I think I'm going to finally do it, it should take me 3-4 days before I die of a liver failure.",1
I am a young guy and I have chronic nerve pain for over a year. This affects my life severely. I have already received several medical treatments but with no results. Now I take opiates and valium to suppress the pain but still have pain. I think about suicide every day. I am convinced that this is the only solution to be pain free. I have no hope for my future. I'm ready to end my life.,1
"Maybe I deserve to die I’ve had a horrible childhood and and it made me become a horrible person. I was sexually abused as a child and it made me abuse people without knowing it was a bad thing until I was older when I learned what sex was. It haunts me everyday and I wish I could end my life and rid myself of this constant struggle in my consciousness. My day is run by intrusive and anxious thoughts and traumatic sexualization has left me with intrusiveness thoughts I’d never want anyone to have and it makes me feel disgusted every time it crosses my mind but when I think of how gross it is, it’s like my brain forces me to see it and think about it. I feel like I have no connection with my friends or anyone around me. I always feel hated and like nobody truly loves me, even the things I used to enjoy just bring me pain and mental suffering due to my hppd from years of drug abuse since I was 15 I’m about to be 20 and I feel slower and more useless than I’ve ever felt. I never feel whole. I’m always suffering if I’m not mentally absent by drug usage or just disconnected from reality. I think I’m gonna end it soon maybe I was meant to just die so others can live a happy life.",1
"I think of killing myself soon and the thought of it is the only thing that makes me be at peace for a while. Parents didn't raise me right. No social skills, grew up with self-doubt, anxiety and fear. Was in love with a girl for 4 years and I ruined it, she left me like it was nothing, dropped out from University while my friends were graduating, I was forced to do a course I didn't like by my parents and lost 4 years there doing nothing. Tried to do something I liked and did good in life for the first time, but all I think of is how my life has been nothing but a big failure, no friends, I'm hopeless and I know future is more painful than I thought it to be. I just want to end it here, I've done a lot of mistakes, now I just don't have the fight in me to go on with life. I need peace, death is the only thing that can grant me that. Encouraging words would only make one feel good for a day, but I know there's nothing but death that can bring me to rest after all this.",1
"the other night i was going to kill myself. didnt, and now im like hmm well i have to so and idk im just tired of living like this. my thoughts are on loop and im tired of the whole cycle, ive just gotta end it now",1
I feel like I'm reaching a crisis point. I have been diagnosed with depression and suicidal thoughts have been coming to me more and more. I have multiple ways in which I think I would do it but there's just something each time that stops me. I had a massive breakdown yesterday and I was stood at the top of a fire escape wanting to jump but my friend literally phoned me while I was up there so I came down and then later in the day I was going to cut my wrists but I just couldn't do it and I phoned my mum crying to her for like an hour. Even when I feel okay or relatively good I still think about killing myself and i'm scared that all it will take will be one mistake and I'll be dead,1
"ew I'm gonna die fat that's embarrassing I cant deal with this life anymore (okay it's been so many years i've been saying this tho... Ig I'm telling lies), and i cant even starve properly anymore. ew my corpse will be ugly, can't wait to be a skeleton",1
Painless suicide? Whats the most painless method,1
I want to die because life seems way to exhausting,1
"I hate my shitty (toxic/abusive) family. They are so shitty. I used my aunts coffee mug to drink tea and grandma snitched on me and told her and now aunt is all like “I’m not drinking out of it ever again cause she touched it.” And when I used the can opener to open a can of tuna (which I don’t even use. Probably my first time using it this year) they said they are hiding the can opener from me so I can’t use it. I fucking hate them. They are so fucking petty and ridiculous. Yet I buy dish soap, paper towels, some food and they eat up and use all my shit and I hate them but I don’t go saying you can’t use that cause I’m not that fucking selfish. Godamnnn like wtf. Like they hate me so fucking much and act like that then wonder why I don’t talk and want to be around them at all.",1
I have a baby sister who I love dearly but it's been getting worse and worse for me. I hate it when she sees me depressed I hate when I wake her up bc I was t crying too loud. I think she has some sort of undiagnosed autism she gas a speech impediment and is socially underdeveloped. I need to kill myself but I'm her only friend. How do I do it in a way that won't do any harm to her,1
 want to kill myself I'm so sad and lonely I wish I had anybody to talk to,1
Really fucking wish I died that day… Tried to suicide attempt but fucking flopped. Note to self eating 15 paracetomals wont kill you only fuck your body up. And I really thought I was gonna do better but here we are.,1
"I just want to be not around. I think the actual act of suicide is terrifying as most people would think, but I just constantly wish I didn’t have to be born or continue on. Sure, there are happy parts in life but it’s really annoying how people argue “that’s worth living” because in all honesty it is not. I remember about 4 years ago I almost did ‘it’ but didn’t and I regret that. After that, I told myself it will get better, but it doesn’t. And now even 4 years later I feel like I’m stuck in such a bad place that’s it’s not even worth it to dig out of.",1
"I make so many mistakes and never learn from them. This shit has caught up to me and I have lost friends because of it. No matter how hard I try, I cannot improve myself I am not going to immediately kill myself after this post, but it’s definitely going to be in the back of my mind So many friends ghost me; I have a clinginess issue and I sometimes say things that cause arguments. Somebody literally told me “you’re dead to me” So I might as well be legally dead, right? Doesn’t help that most guys I talk to I gain feelings towards (I am bi) and I make it sort of obvious and they ofc ghost me I don’t even have to like the person to ghost me; I have an unlikeable personality that cannot be changed After I release my upcoming EP I am going to make a decision",1
"Is it scary to die. I just want it all to be over but I don't know why I am so terrified. Lastnight I could have overdosed and died. What stopped me? My f*cking fear did. With the amount of atihistamine, caffiene, and tylenol pills that I have, I could have very well been dead by morning. But no. I can't do it. I seriously need to find a way to follow through with it I am in agonizing pain .",1
i will kill myself because i'm ugly but don't know when i don't have body dysmorphism,1
"I'm not sure but I used to want to kill myself. I was age 9 and had a abusive mother who got my custody. I recently got therapy but It doesn't calm me or hell me vent. Recently, when seeing the way the world is heading, I not only want to kill myself but go on a mass murder spree beforehand. I dont have the strength to do it just yet. But I have a feeling it's going to happen soon. Sorry. I just needed to vent.",1
"I think I’m gonna kill myself Idk I don’t really feel anything, I’m a failure, I let everyone down, so I think once I get back to my dads tomorrow I’ll write some suicide notes, take a bunch of Benadryl and some weed and slit my wrist in my bathtub, sounds like a good plan I think but then again I literally don’t feel anything rn",1
"I am tired of self harming, the cuts look awful",1
I just did a coin flip to kill myself.,1
"It was kind of the only thing i wanted to do, before i seriously give in, but thoughts of my family is holding me back from killing myself atm.",1
"I don't wanna die, i want to live. I want happiness, i want this pain to leave me alone. I need help but there's no one to help.",1
"I tried to kill myself And I want to try it again. I tried to slit my wrists but didn't even hit the vein. It was pathetic. I felt like everyone in the hospital was just laughing at me. I told my parents if they didn't make me go to inpatient I wouldn't try it again, but I want to so bad. I'm in so much pain all the time.",1
"I keep wishing my life would just end. I want to get out ahead. I have this feeling, deep inside of me, that I know it's a truth. That despite my general contentedness at this point in time, I've peaked. From here, it can only get worse. I'm not brave enough to actually actively commit suicide, but I find myself wishing my heart would just stop beating in my quiet, alone moments.",1
"I was thinking, how can I reach out for help OR better yet what are some ways to curb suicidal thoughts? I'm not so bad yet that I've attempted, but I think about multiple times daily. How could I reach out or stop some suicidal thoughts(sadly some of this is incited by one of my cats starting Roche mean to me, because my cats are probably the only reason I'm here except for my sister)",1
please tell me a way i cant kill myself. i cant cut because im a pussy ive been considering drowning and ive tried it. but i dont know my life is going to be fucking hell more then now in a couple years even more then now. im to mentally il to get a job and i dont have any friends really. il just be sitting in my house on disability befits for 40 years its going to be so fucking miserable im a waste of resources fuck me dont fucking tell me it will get better im tiered of hearing it im done i think im going to try to drown myself. tm. idk .hope i found a better way. just please help me with this im in pain and i need to end it,1
"i’ve wanted to end my life since i was maybe 12-13. I’m 17 now and haven’t thought about suicide or depression in months. I always thought things would simply just get better and eventually they kinda did, after i got my girlfriend back in november everything seemed fine but now she’s been kinda distancing herself from me and ignoring me and saying she’s annoyed from my presence and like 2-3 days ago i just got so lonely that i just started thinking about life and suicide and everything bad that was happening to me before I had my girfriend. I mean i’m not gonna kill myself if she leaves me or anything because if i kill myself over a partner i’ll seem stupid or dumb. i just finally came to my realization that everything is still bad even after i got my girlfriend and i was just so focused on her that i never had my thoughts of suicide because i was happy with her. now i just came back to my realization about how i was before my girlfriend and killing myself in a few years like i planned to just has came naturally these past few days and it just doesnt seem bad thing for me to do",1
I just want to die I no longer want to be a burden in this world all I ever do is disappoint and make people mad and sad I just wanna hang myself,1
"The worst thought I have ever had and keep having is that when I kill myself, I'll be too heavy to to be picked up (I'm fat) I dont want to be here",1
"I’m trying to keep up with the pace but I keep falling behind. My mind is a hole I fall into when I wake Filled with pain I try to escape I just want to give up, my life i take I don’t care if it gets better It will only get worse because I’ll wait for the pain to come back Fear that I’ll fall again into that dark abyss I won’t ever get out When I feel I’m digging up I’m really digging down into a deeper hole to hit rock bottom. There’s no rock bottom. I think life can only be so bad but then I hit the core and now I’m burning. Burning at every mistake, word, and thought. Then when I speak it’s like my throat is ash. Every pronunciation of a word is another foot deeper in the hole. The people look at me and I just fall deeper. The people ignore me and I die.",1
"Almost got enough fluoxetine to finally do what I've been wanting to since I was 12. I've been pretending to take my pills for a few days, I take 60 MG a day. With the bottle I already have, plus a ""refill"" from my pharmacist, I'll have 1000 MG available to me. Finally.",1
I just feel like no one wants me around even though I've been told this isn't the case but still. I just want to kill myself. I started on antidepressants two weeks ago because my doctor said they'd be useful in time to help manage feelings but so far they've done nothing. Every day is a struggle to keep myself alive. Since I'm barely eating I'm starting to lose weight. I can't focus on anything I enjoy. I live in a toxic environment because my mom is a narcissist and it's so draining to be around her. I just want to feel better.,1
"I honestly can't do it anymore. Home is too toxic, trauma haunts me more and more, I can't be supported or accepted for who I am, I can't escape, I can't do run away, I can't. I just can't. Idk what to do. There's nothing left to help me. I really just wanna die. I'm scared. Please. Someone just help me",1
"Trying to get help, but I just wanna die. So I’m bipolar and suffer from codependency, my only coping mechanism were cocaine and sex. I recently started going to therapy and started taking medication, but I got hurt and I instantly attempted… um I woke up in a hospital after two days, and now I’m getting real help, but I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m trying like I said I’m in and optionally home I could leave but I won’t, but it’s hard and I wanna leave I miss my flat, I miss my drugs, I miss my mate, I miss my dog I just feel like life would be easier if I just turned it off and started doing drugs. Sorry I needed to rant and I’m asking for advice.",1
"I just want to die. I used to think about killing myself but then be too scared to experience the pain of sitting my wrists or stabbing myself. But honestly, the last few months I find myself not caring if it hurts I honestly just want to fucking die. I fucking hate everyone around me so I don’t care how they feel when I’m gone I just want to not exist anymore. It’s not always so much that I want to kill myself sometimes I just wish I was never born or I could get hit by a car or something.",1
"God I want to kill myself so bad. I guess I am having anxiety attacks, my brain goes completely numb sometimes when I am asked to do a thing. I can't function. I have a family history of mental illnesses and I hate those people. My family is so full of shit in every regard of life. I don't want to be like them at all but I can't help but keep falling into the same path. What should I do? My life is ruined. I won't be able to achieve the life I always wanted. Fuck my household, they ruined me. I was destined to be nothing. Fuck my life. Fuck destiny. Fuck each and every one of my family members. All my friends are doing good but not me I am hitting the lowest of lows in my life. Killing myself is the only answer.",1
"Hate my life. I want to get this off my chest I hate the way I look, my laziness, my life I dislike it I’ve tried working out getting a better schedule getting hair products but I can’t keep doing whatever I’m doing. I’m just tired I don’t wanna do this anymore, I avoid looking in mirrors cause I genuinely hate how I look I hate school and my social anxiety makes me want to kill myself everytime I leave my house. I’m becoming an adult and I don’t want to be an adult looking and feeling like this. I’ve been bullied and had no friends I thought that I had improved but I haven’t I tried to cut my wrist but the blade was to blunt I can’t even do that right, I feel so ugly and abnormal I feel like everyone is staring at me judging me but before someone says they aren’t they are I had a group of girls stare and make fun of me. I’m so tired I can’t go anymore.",1
"i really just want to escape this crap of a life i have.. i am dumb, poor, and ugly i cant do shit. I just want to die and go to a different world like in animes.",1
"I legit have no idea. I’m almost done with uni, just got my first job, I’ve got hobbies I’m passionate about, I’m in a healthy relationship. I hate myself. I haven’t cut myself in weeks purely because it doesn’t even give me the high I’m looking for. I’ve just been doing everything you’re supposed to do. I wanna die I wanna die I’m a piece of shit. I thought doing everything right would make me feel good. I kinda feel like killing myself would still be kinda cool. I just want to be forgotten.",1
"So so tired of constantly never being enough. Not pretty enough, not smart enough, not clean enough, not well enough put together. I didn’t deserve all of the abuse and suffering I’ve gone through in this pathetic life. I’m tired. And I don’t want to do this anymore.",1
"I just want to give up and end it all. I guess that makes a coward huh? A selfish coward, at that. Most people think the reasoning behind suicide is not feeling like anyone cares, or that no one would miss you. But for me, that’s not the case. I know people love me, and that’s what’s holding me back. Anytime something difficult happens I just think to myself “if I kill myself I won’t have to deal with this”. I’m a terrible person and though people would miss me, I would definitely be better dead because all I do is hold people back. I’m completely useless. I mean, I can’t even do my homework. I’m failing in just about every class, and there’s not enough time for me to catch up. The term will end soon. I’m a lazy piece of shit who stays in their room and cries. I complain about how much my life sucks but I never do anything to change it. I always blame everyone else for how I feel. I’m not strong enough, or motivated enough to live. I just don’t want to do it. I’m a wuss, I’ll admit it. I just can’t handle life. I mean, death is inevitable. I may as well save the time, right?",1
I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. my own family doesn’t even love me,1
"I have plans now. Now I think of it, it might be painful but the pain in the life is everyday. This will be one time and im gone forever. After all why shouldn't i do it. nobody would care other than the mess i will make. Slitting is the best I can do. I cannot live like this. This is painful. Guess this is my time",1
"I wouldn't care much about pain if it weren't for the only thing I could kill myself with is a knife (or pills that have an extremely low lethality), and if it hurts too much I'd probably just puss out. Even if I manage to go through with it I'd probably wake up in a hospital and have to deal with everyone knowing about it. I just wish I had a gun or rope so I could do it easily and almost certainly die.",1
I’ve never been so alone in my life. I keep saying that but it keeps getting worse and I don’t know how much longer I can handle it. I don’t think any longer honestly. Spending the last half hour of my birthday crying and alone because I’m not worth anyone’s time. I am an afterthought. Fuck this.,1
Semester going badly might end my life Finals coming up getting an A in one class failing the others. Deal isolated from friends. Mentally unhappy can’t rally to pepper because clubs are dead at my school. Thinking of throwing myself on I70. Used to be good at engineering now due to Covid I am not. I have no hands on experience because of Covid. No company will hire me. I deserve to die. I consider myself a failure,1
My dads in the intensive care unit at the hospital and all I keep thinking about is cutting myself.,1
I'm going to kill myself today,1
"if my boyfriend leaves me ill most likely kill myself i know this sounds toxic as fuck. i never have, nor will i ever hold something like this against him. but i am scared shitless that if he ever leaves me i won’t have the courage to move on. he’s the only reason i want to do anything, he’s my only form of happiness",1
"i made my decision. i'm planning on killing myself in a month or 2. i promised i'd end it this year, it's the only one i intend to keep. i know how absolutely useless i am. and i dont care what happens. to me or my family. because this isnt real. i dont feel a connection to anything or anyone. it's all meaningless. i would rather die than be conscious for longer",1
I was going to kill myself three days ago. I reached out for help. I called two of the three people I feel like I’m at all close to. I got routed to daily in-patient psych visits and some new referrals and meds. I regret all of it. I wish more than anything I had just had the resolve to kill myself instead of being too afraid of the pain. I wish that I had died and never asked someone for help.,1
"I have been suicidal for over five years, attempted suicide at least 10 times, but have never actually been serious about it. Tomorrow, i have decided i will go to a local bridge. There, I will finally make the decision of whether or not i should end it all. If anybody cares, i will update this tomorrow if i am alive. If I'm not, well, its been one hell of a ride",1
"Suicidal again. Haven’t felt suicidal in about 7 years. In hindsight, I blamed the drugs. Well it’s back, but not the drugs. The problem is now I’ve got a wife and three kids. What kind of a pussy leaves that behind? Part of me wants to head down to the hood and start throwing around the N word in hopes of getting gunned down, but that ain’t my luck. I’d just become the racist asshole trending across the globe. I can’t think of an “accidental” method outside of a car accident and that offers no guarantee.",1
I’m tired. Every thing is too hard for me to do at this time. I have two bottles of vodka which I am thinking of chugging and just stop the pain.,1
"Please help me.I have bought the necessary materials to a painless suicide, (obviously I will not list them) and I am planning to take my life tonight. Every second, I become less motivated to live, and I need help ASAP",1
I’m terrified. My life is fucked. I think someone is hacking into my phone. I wanna die,1
"ive got to kill myself before i get kittens my mom knows that i like cats, so shes trying to get me a kitten. i cant leave it alone, because my family doesnt like cats, so ive gotta kill myself before i get one.",1
I wanted to commit suicide today but then I got Taco Bell instead,1
"Next time I want to commit suicide, I'm keeping it to myself Telling people, ain't worth it. It's not like they aren't still going to judge you if you do kill yourself. They don't understand the pain. Please just allow me to die!",1
It never fucking does. People have even telling me that for years and it’s only gotten worse. I’ve lost most of my friends and I’m finding it so hard to make new ones. Nobody really fucking cares about me. It’s all just fake bs. I’m considering just ending it all. Life fucking sucks,1
I just came up with 22 reasons to kill myself I can’t come up with any reasons to live. Not one.,1
Lately all I can think about is suicide. I’ve been suicidal for years and it keeps getting worse.it’s at the point where suicide is the only thing I think about. I cannot get any help since I’m still 17 and my parents refuse to get me help. I had a psychologist for a while but it didn’t help at all. I’m in so much pain and I can’t do this anymore.,1
"i just want to stop existing sure I want to be dead, but am not interested in the pain that's involved. i want to just not exist. eternal sleep. im exhausted. what am i even trying for??? too bad I wuss out.",1
"I'm going to kill myself now...hopefully this time I'll be successful Hello....in the end I have to kill myself because I just can't stand myself ,everything I do or say makes me a piece of shit so rather then being alive and be a garbage person all the time I wanna kill myself so I won't be able to do any other shitty things ,I don't know why I am this way I guess that much of rotten person I don't know why I'm alive to begin with...so hopefully this is the day I'll put an end to all of this",1
Killing myself. I keep trying.. Today is the day I must get it over with.. I cannot live like this anymore.. I was a good man.. Goodbye everyone.,1
"im thinking of jumping off the bridge on the way home tomorrow idk its not like im in constant pain or anything, i kinda just give up. i fell behind on everything while everyone else seems to be doing just fine. i cant memorize or focus on anything, i just feel blank. the world around me is moving too fast and im always a hundred steps behind. i cant even feel motivated to try and do better because i know every possible outcome would leave me just as miserable. i put it off for a while because i didnt want to cause my family such shame, but im kinda over that now. im too tired",1
"i'm intentionally destroying my life.i started smoking weed and drinking alcohol in an attempt to set my self down the path of slowly killing myself. thinking of drinking myself to death soon so it can be over. there is really no point and i have no motivation to live, as nothing satisfies me anymore.",1
I don't know if it's for real this time but I just feel like I can never fix what I've done and there is no way someone would help me. I really just want to give up. I really feel like suicide is the only way out of this.I'm still waiting for the day I break I guess.,1
"I don’t want a reason to live. I don’t want my life to be saved by anybody or anything. I just wanna die. I don’t even wanna be happy, I just wanna die.",1
I had a dream about killing myself. I tried to hang myself in my backyard while my brother was watching me. Maybe soon this dream will come true.,1
"School is making me suicidal. I only started college a few weeks ago and im already feeling the stress. If i fail my sem again, i will be kicked out. In my country, ur basically useless if u dont have a college diploma. I currently have no support system and my parents are super abusive.",1
i’m tired of faking like i’m feeling okay all day and then falling back into my depressive states and crying myself to sleep at night. it’s like a weird routine i’ve caught on because no one around me takes it seriously. they usually make me feel ashamed for being depressed.. i’m so tired of living,1
"At this point, I'm living life out on the sole fact that I'm curious about what future college I'll be attending, what dating feels like, what job I'll end up with, who I'll end up with, and the likes. If it weren't for all that, I might have already stopped trying by now. To be honest, it's getting harder to look forward to these things but I keep telling myself to live it through for the hell of it.",1
"i dont actually want to die i just want things to change but 6 or however many attempts later,, idk i lost count, its clearly not changing. things clearly dont get better. i dont understand why i dont just kill myself right now. theres something holding me back and i dont know what. my boyfriend? who fucking knows, all i know is that right now i feel just as worthless as ever before and asking myself for the millionth time when will i get a fucking break? when will i NOT hate every waking minute of my life? lol. the only good thing in my life is my boyfriend and with my track record im going to fuck that up too so (: i dont want to hurt him i really dont and i know if i killed myself it would hurt him, but i got a life time of trauma at 18 and it eats away at me day in and day out and nobody can make it stop.",1
I'm killing myself tonight. I'm saying it here because nobody can know other than the internet. Don't try to talk me out of it.,1
"Failed a year of med school, thinking about killing myself. I have always been a very high achieving student but this year has been very rough for me due to struggling with depression. I failed my third year of medical school and I am going to have to repeat it because of that. Medicine is already too long (7+ years in my country) and I feel like I have wasted away my life. I am really considering to end it all. There is no way in hell I can accept failing a year as someone who has always been one of the top students.",1
"Is shooting yourself in the head a painless way to die? Today this is one of the few thoughts i had and i really need an answer. I don’t know how to kill myself so that i feel no pain and this seems like an option. If not, what painless ways are there?",1
Goodbye Nobody cares so I'm gonna kill myself,1
"How do I kill myself. I should have been dead almost a decade ago, I was diagnosed with type one Diabetes on my 8th birthday and should have died then. No one knows or cares that I exist most I've met either have forgotten me or agree I should be dead. I've tried overdosing on insulin but now I have a dexcom and it's just harder to do it again. I'm so fucking worthless not ever the dead want me. So how do I kill myself, if you want anymore information please just look at my past posts I'm to retarded to do anything and might just go with a knife if I can't do anything else I am going to give 40 some unit of insulin tonight I'm so tired",1
"My plan is to slowly degrade myself. I have been thinking. And I also saw another post that inspired me to do this. I will slowly degrade myself, meaning eat junk food, no excercise, start doing drugs and maybe alcohol. Death will come sooner and it's the most painless way imo, just takes more time.",1
"Recently I have begun to feel more and more suicidal. After an argument and a huge sense of guilt due to this I have stopped telling people how I am feeling. The only person I tell is my therapist, I regularly picture my suicide: different ways to do it, how people will react, what I would write to people. I have written multiple drafts, I don't know if I will do it because I am scared of what it will be like and the thought of there being nothing after this is a strange thing to comprehend. But I also think that I am capable of doing it as I can be very reckless and make decisions or do things with very little thought. When I think about killing myself sometimes I feel comfort, sometimes I feel sad, and sometimes I just don't feel anything. I don't really know what I'm asking here but I just thought I best put it out somewhere because it is a thought that plagues my mind for a good portion of the days.",1
"Im just sad. I just stay alive, so the people i like dont have to be sad, but i dont even know if they would notice, i mean not a single soul would miss me i think, and if i die in an accident today i would be happy, because im finally dead and other people dont have to ask themselve why i killed myself, but if im honest i just wanna kill myself",1
I need info on how hospitals hold people. I dont feel safe with myself and I almost hung myself but didnt and I dont know what to do. I dont have money for a hospital at all so im not sure this is worth asking but its worth a shot if I decide to wake up tomorrow. fuck,1
my cut/scratched my arm so fucking much. i got mad and i scratched my arm with a blade from a pencil sharpener. this one was very fucking sharp so now i have fucking red marks all over my arm i cant lay down because it stings and starts bleeding.i think il just sleep with my hoodie can anyone help,1
"Insufferable pain. It feels inhumane for someone to suffer like this and continue on to do so. This is so fucking painful, I won't be able to take it any longer. I just wanna go.",1
"I'd give anything to have it in me to end my life. I just can't fucking do it anymore. I have no one. I'm not able to get myself to shower, or do dishes, or look into jobs/therapy, or even think about going back to school, nothing. I want it all to be over. I'm sick of being useless. I bring suffering in my wake. It'd all be so much better if I were dead, so fucking much better.",1
"Is this where I give it all up. I want to end it so badly, I honestly don't know what's keeping me going. And I'd love to get help but ik my step mom would get pissed. I don't know what to do anymore. I came out as nonbinary and my parents go out of their way to use my dead pronouns and that hurts a lot.",1
"Subconsciously killing myself. I used to have so many plans of ending my life. Different ways. Timings. I don't have those thoughts anymore...but I feel 10x more suicidal...if not, more. I feel like I'm in denial about my depression/suicide. I've never seen anyone to diagnose me, therefore I feel my emotions are invalid and just attention seeking. I've been pushing away my feelings of sadness for some time now...maybe even years. But it's recently hitting me hard. Again. I dnt feel like killing myself. But I feel like I'm killing myself subconsciously. I'm using hard drugs now. Drinking daily and twice as much. I'm driving recklessly. And working poor. I don't feel suicidal. But I've realized I've gave up. Is this subconscious? Or just a bump in the road?",1
"Suicidal thoughts. I don’t want to kill myself I just wanna go to sleep and never wake back up I’m so tired of living this horrible life, school just makes it worst and I’m tired of it. I feel like today is that day to end all my pain and worries",1
Im fucking done. I just want to die i dont know how to do it. I dont eant my family to have to pay for my coffin. How can i do it without gettkng found. I dont want therapy,1
"I just want to kill myself. I can't stand it anymore, I am afraid that my family and friends will miss me, but the pressure is too much and I don't think I will be eable to take it longer. I'm sorry",1
Why do people reach out to you knowing you’re suicidal and then complain about you being suicidal? Does that make any sense? It seems like nobody has a brain these days,1
"I’ve been planning this attempt for a while tbh why I’m going trough with it I dunno honestly I have everything a teenager could ask for it’s just I’m existing for the sake of existing. I’m tired of being a failure I know That my family doesn’t care anymore and I know help will never come asking,receiving,giving and taking nothing is here to help I’m just breathing wasting time someone else could have had. I plan on being nice to everybody this week before it’s over I hope everyone can be happy together for a while. I stopped imagining. Heaven because I know people like me wouldn’t be there on their best days. I just want this to be over",1
"I have no worth. I find that Everyone in my life is better than me. I’m always interrupted, my ideas are always shot down, I’ve been a failure all my life and no matter what I do I’m too tired or too stupid to do it. I’m too scared to ever end my own life but I know if I did, life would go on and I’d be forgotten by those who loved me. Sometimes I wish I had the guts to do it, but I don’t think I ever will.",1
"I really wanna die, I mean I know I'm not special and all because everyone has their own struggles but no one ever listens to mine, I'm always everyone else's support but whenever someone tries to reach out to me I just completely shut down, my parents are both shit to me and I feel like I really wouldn't regret dying its just hard for me to suppress all of these thoughts and soon I feel like I'm going to do it.",1
i wish there's an easy way to kill myself. i'd be already dead if death is guaranteed when i kill myself. what if i dont die but fall into a coma? or worse continue living as a suicide survivor? i don't think i'll ever be able to face my parents/friends when that happen.. isn't it too embarrassing,1
"I am so tired of everything, I don't even want to type here anything because it doesn't matter, I just want to meet someone and hug them.",1
I hate myself so fucking much,1
"I wanna die right now! I am a girl who has yet to finish high school and I have struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm since the 7th grade. Today I made the mistake of missing the bus by a minute because I forgot my keys and didn't want to be locked out, because of that I had to ask my step dad for a ride. He said okay while my mom proceeded to yell at me over text about how stupid I am, how much of a failure I am, how I made her get up early to get the kids ready for school, etc.(she didn't say that but it felt like that). I now have to do millions of chores when I get home, I now have to be at the bus stop 10 minutes earlier than my usual time and I will probably lose my phone for a week. I honestly just wanna die, I have been so stressed because of school and my life just keeps going to sh*t so I honestly just wanna die. Im not sure how or if I should but honestly this was my breaking point. What do I do? Keep fighting this horrible battle or finally just tap out?",1
"the pain is crushing me. i can't keep pretending everything is fine. I'm so close to the breaking point. no one knows how much I want to do it, and I don't know how much longer i can take it. everyone thinks I'm so happy. but the truth is I'm so tired of faking it",1
I am not cut out for this world. I’ve really been making a genuine effort to keep trying for my family’s sake. But recently nothing has been working out and it feels like the world doesn’t want me. I can’t find a job. I can’t find a place to live. I just want to give up and be done with it.,1
"After taking about 100 pills and alcohol I had seizures and then everything was a blur. Everything hurts, I can't stop crying, I'm on a drip and oxygen. I have no motivation to live and I can't die. I need help",1
I just want to blow my fucking brains out. Everyday I feel less like myself. No one fucking understands what goes through my head. It’s so unexplainable. If my parents were to die I wouldn’t be able to have the emotions I would usually have. I would just feel no emotion. I fantasize a bullet entering my skull cracking it going through my brain destroying everything I know and just ricocheting my entire fucking brain. Losing my thoughts and what make you you is the worst fucking hell and agony I’ve felt. I would rather have everyone I know die and become homeless consume every other problem then to lose my personality. and I’m losing it .,1
I’m really depressed and I need to talk to someone. I’m feeling really depressed and lonely and really could use a friend to talk to. I feel like sobbing and hurting myself. I’m contemplating suicide and hanging myself. I’m thinking of trying it from a pulley system. Thanks. Goodbye if I don’t get back in time.,1
"School is about to end. I don’t know what I want to do with my life I feel like I’m just wasting time and money on trying to get a well paying job to impress other people, and to prove to people that I’m not as stupid as they thought I am/was. I honestly want to die I see no meaning in living in this rat race.",1
"I wanted to kill myself last nigh. I didn’t have a plan, just a bottle of gin and my clothes to fashion into a rope. I walked over 15 miles in the middle of no where trying to find a good enough spot. I just ended up sitting there crying my eyes out and it felt good I haven’t cried in a long time. I thought I’d reach out to the out of hour’s doctors they said they would call me back but my phone died. Obviously because they could get through to me police were called and know all of my family knows. I guess I want to die I just don’t want to kill myself And that’s okay",1
"My whole life I struggled with my mental health keeping it a secret from my family. When I was young my mom had me admitted because I would cry randomly. So from there on I just tried to pretend that everything was okay. I'm tired of feeling like my back is against a wall, I'm tired of having financial problems, I'm tired of being addicted to drugs, I'm just tired of life. I just want to go to sleep",1
i'm tired. i'm so fucking tired,1
"I often realize that there is nothing I can do to stop this horrible pain I feel in my head. Even when I should be fine, its still there. I should be fine. I'm not fine. Everything still feels like it's all falling apart. It's never ending, it just quiets down. It's like a hum in my head. A hum that's stuck and I can't get it out. I can't help but think I'm hopeless and helpless.",1
I want to die. I want to go see my dog again. I'm done.,1
"I wish so badly that I had access to all the tools adults have. Guns, cars, poison I mean I'm only 16 but I can't get any of that. I don't wanna wait another couple years to get them either. But I have to so... idk. Fuck man I just want to die.",1
Im thinking about committing suicide but dont want to upset family members or friends. That's the only thing stopping me and I feel more and more tempted by the day I'm thinking about just overdosing and finally ending it. I dont want to but I feel theres no other option,1
"Feeling So Alone. I’m at this point in life where I feel so empty and I don’t want to keep going. I don’t have a boyfriend anymore and I don’t have any friends. I’m failing several classes as well with nobody to blame but myself. Things at home aren’t that much better either... I just want some reason to keep going, just something. I don’t have any desire to live past at least next week. I just want it all to stop.",1
"I wrote a suicide letter. I’m thinking about ending everything tonight. I can’t take this anymore. I’m alone, nobody cares and I’m afraid that if I tell a family about this they will have me institutionalized. I don’t want to live anymore!! This sadness has become too much to handle",1
"I just want to stop existing. No one cares about me. Everyone hates me. My mental illness is too much for them to want to deal with. Everyone wants to argue with me and blame me for things. I just want to erase myself from the minds of everyone that ever knew me. I want to disappear into a dark hole and never be heard from again. I want to die, but even more than that. I want to never have existed at all. No one cares. This is just like shouting into space. No one even responds on this sub. I know I will die by my own hand and no one will even try to stop me because my life is meaningless.",1
"It’s all done. My boyfriend doesn’t care about me, only himself. We argue a lot but I’ve been trying to make things better and he doesn’t seem to get that the things he does makes things worse and that’s why I start mentioning why I’m sad. I told him I was upset and he didn’t care. I’m going to cut again today, I’m not clean for long but now I want it to be a habit again. I’m tired of being hurt all day and I need to feel something else. Why does he do this to me? I wish I had the guts to kill myself because I’d have already done it by now. Part of me wants him to know so he realises what he’s doing is affecting me but he wouldn’t care either way. He’d probably be happy I was gone.",1
I need help. I’m slowly started back cutting ... I don’t want to but I have an urge I’m tired of living and when I want help or I want to talk to somebody no ones there for me but I’m always there for them. I stopped eating two weeks ago and no one noticed and I’m just can’t live life anymore I’m tired of school I’m tired of everything!!,1
I just need someone to tell me to go killmyself in my face from someone personal or someone i care about or I need something bad to happen to me... Please god please I want to fucking die i cant stand living on this wretched earth anymore cant eat a full meal without busting into tears because i want to fucking kill myself 3 more months left until my birthday gonna end it then,1
I want to die! I’m just too weak for this world! I can’t take it anymore. I just want to give up once and for all ; (,1
I’m feeling really hopeless. Right when it starts getting better it just gets worse. I can’t do this anymore. I cut myself again today. I want to kill myself I’m tired of feeling this way.,1
"Kicked into special ed when i was 6 years old bc of aspergers and adhd, never really knew how to socialize with any if the normal kids. Got into highschool special ed and was hated by everyone.. not like bullying but genuine hatred. Like ""fuck OP"" chanting n stuff. Got bery depressed around age 14 and got a therapist that didnt take me serious, just like my parents. At around 15 i had a mental breakdown while high and developed dpdr. A year later at 16 i had been addicted to some stuff. Alcohol, weed and like 3 energy drinks a day. Then when i got meds ( prozac ) i had to quit it all... i didnt and had bad effects. So i started self harming which was bad, ive seen my mum cry over it. I decided to take more then 4x as many pills as im allowed to in hopes of killing myself. Didnt work but i didnget serotonin syndrome out of it. Now my dad told me to just kms already... should i? I mean ive been shit my whole life and i dont see it getting better yk. Fml",1
"Buying a gun this week. I’m gonna go to the gun shop and put my name in to buy a gun. Shouldn’t have a problem bcuz I can be deceiving enough to look happy, but once I get that gun I’m gonna drive to a cliff and shoot myself in the head.",1
"I just listened to a song I hadn't listened to since then about a decade ago now, and I suddenly remembered how I would listen to it on repeat on the bus while fantasizing about ending my life. Eventually I got out of the bad situation I was in and I found some things to live for for 7+ years, but lately I have been having a really hard time again",1
"Im so alone. Im so alone and im gonna be alone forever I dont want to live. I dont want to grow up with the pain. Seeing my family die before me, seeing the people that left me doing better than me, and seeing her so happy with another guy. Its so hard. Its so hard its so hard its so hard i want to die so badly i want it to be painless i dont want to feel pain i just want to go. I wish people stayed with me. I wish i wasnt so horrible and made people uncomfortable i wish i was normal. I really want someone to kill me i want to die in some way i dont want to go to hell",1
"Am I alone? I’m afraid on a daily basis that I’m not good enough for the people who need me to be good enough. I spend almost all of my time worried that I’m dispensable, forgettable and undesirable. I feel alone and ashamed. I hate myself more and more every day I can’t feel normal.",1
Just need to vent My parents emotionally traumatized me and then all of a sudden they give a fuck. They go around acting like some fucking god and then treat me like shit and expect me to tell them everything. Like what the fuck? Are you drunk or someting? Where is your head? They are insane if they think I’m going to go up to the people that put me in this state and ask them for help. Why wouldn't I want to die when I got nobody to go to but 3 people online and I can't even get a genuine hug. All the people that actually give a damn are somewhere on the other side of town. I don't even have fucking hope for the future. I thank you for wasting your time. Have a good day.,1
"He left me with his pain. My soulmate, my bestfriend. He took his life and blamed it on me. He knew about all my trauma and decided to take his life when I finally did what was best for me. He’s gone now he’s not breathing anymore and I can’t live with these what if’s or what I could’ve done. I’ve never been more suicidal before this. I want to be with him. His family blames me. I can’t deal with anymore trauma. Years and years go by and more trauma enters my life. I didn’t even expect to make it this far in life. I wanna go I wanna go",1
Wish I died. My tire blew out on the highway because it was mounted wrong. I'm so upset that I didn't die. I wish I panicked and rolled my car. I had a friend die from the same thing a few years ago. Why didn't I die. It's not fair.,1
"Im scared I'm going to impulsively kill myself. I have extrem mood swings and at one point I could be looking at a future for myself and at another I'm close to jumoing out of my window or ODing. I really want to just be sent to an Emergency room and receive some sort of treatment, but everyones going to judge me, everyone. Maybe its for the best if I impulsively kill myself.",1
"I want to feel pain. If I’m gonna end it, then I’m going out in the most brutal ways possible. Rather it be setting myself on fire or mutilating myself with a fucking chainsaw. I do not want it to be quick and I want to be found just completely fucked up beyond recognition. Maybe I’ll end up in hell where I deserve to be (if it even exists)",1
I will kill myself because of bullying. I get bullied since I was 5 I am 16 now I never had friendsThere is no hope I hate my life my parents say I should ignore but I got bullied almost every year in my life. This will be the end,1
I’m such a fucking loser. Please just somebody kill me. Let me just go to sleep and not wake up. That would be an absolute godsend.,1
"I’m failing my classes , everything is online, I can’t get anything printed. I work all day and still I can’t get a good passing grade this shit is so fucked. My mental health was terrible anyway and now everything is worse I hate being alive. I literally want to kill myself. I know this shit isn’t even that big of a deal but I just I can’t do it anymore. Therapy fucking sucks, everyone sucks I can’t do this.",1
"I want to kill myself. I really want to end it. Nothing has helped. No therapy, no talking to people, nothing. I'm simply too far gone. I probably will end up killing myself soon. I just don't know how to do it.",1
What do you do when you know you are gay but your last and only 2 gay relationships made you feel afraid and traumatised to be gay so you lie and say you are straight! I don’t want to be gay as it leaves me wanting to die,1
"I recently got into a break up and I just feel so lonely. I literally have nobody to talk too about my breakup.. My family hates when I talk about him but I literally keep it all inside and I just need some guidance and motivation to help me move on… because I already feel like going back. When you feel so lonely, you always feel like you gotta go back to that person when you have nobody on your side  does anybody feel this way or is it just me? I already have thoughts of suicide, even though I have a long life ahead of me and I’m still young. I’ve been having thoughts about it but I never really tried to hurt myself  I don’t think that because he left me and what not,  but I have thoughts because I have nobody. And my therapist is always telling me “you’re never alone” but I am! ?? and I just don’t know what to do anymore… I just need guidance and motivation to help me move forward and make good choices in my life because I’m already giving up at this point …",1
So in your opinion if the voices that keep talking NONSTOP are getting louder and scarier and you had a choice would you check yourself in right away or make an appt with a new counselor because your new to town and have no therapist and no meds. Im so scared! I want it all just to end so the voices will stop but I dont want my granddaughters or daughter to find me since I live with them. I lost my brother to suicide in 2005 and I know what it did to all of us but i also understand feeling like its your only option. Please help me ,1

"Hello everyone, Well what more is there that say? I am alone in this big world. I feel very alone. I do want to enjoy life, but I feel I have nothing to offer and time is running out. I pray the Good Lord shows mercy. I’m looking to end my pain",1
I just want my pain to end,1
I’m so tired. Tired of pretending I want to live. Tired of pretending I am ok. And I am tired of living a lie to appear “normal” when all I want is my old life back. I want to leave this place as this is hell and I want to sleep forever as I can’t take… See More,1

I started taking an antidepressant and my suicidal thoughts and depression is gone. A lot of people are against taking antidepressants but it's better to take those than wanting to kill yourself all the time. Just suggesting it because its helped me A LOT,1

"Personally I don’t want to talk to anyone about how I feel, why are we continually bombarded with requests from help groups telling us to chat, open up, reach out etc.
Don’t these support groups get it! If someone has made their mind up and is comfortable with their decision to kill themselves - why would they want to discuss their decision with a complete stranger.
It’s my decision, I’m happy with it, I’ve thought about it over a long time.",1

"I'm tired of living. At the age of 13 I was gang raped and ended up pregnant. I didn't know who the father of my child was. But all my ex boyfriend's friends beat me an inch too death. I ended up in a coma in the hospital. The doctors did an emergency c-section and my baby didn't make it. I was abuse all my life sexual, emotionally, physically. I did drugs to try to ease the pain. I drank until I became a alcoholic. I don't understand why God put me here on this planet and I will probably never know. I wish I could see my baby again. Sometimes I wish I was never born. I wish it was me that died instead of my baby.",1

"Hi everyone I’m 24 years old, and my best friend and I have been friends since we were 10. He recently took his life and I am in pieces. I feel like no one understands this overwhelming feeling, so many emotions I can’t fully comprehend. It’s been a month today. I just want to talk to someone who knows wtf to say. I’m currently in a program and trying to focus in school and it’s so difficult. He helped me get into this program he would of wanted me to keep going. It honestly feels like all his pain was transferred to me after he passed. The only person I would talk to about these feelings and pain is gone. People just tell me to create a schedule or go for a walk etc. None of that will take this pain away. My bestfriend and I would talk almost daily for years I’m in shock. After I got into the program and started living with my fiancé and his kids, I got really busy, so talking with him turned into every couple days or every week. Before he took his life we didn’t talk for two whole weeks. It breaks my heart why didn’t we talk those TWO WHOLE weeks. It wasn’t like us and I carry so much guilt for that. Why didn’t he tell me. I texted him a couple hours too late that day. He told me before he was suicidal a year before he did it, why didn’t I get him help?? He said he was good I wish I pushed harder to get him help rather than thinking he had this or I could help him alone. His family gave no support absent parents and not so loving guardians. How stupid of me. He was such a beautiful loving person. I can’t get out of bed it’s so hard everyday it’s so hard to get things done.",1

"Does anyone else not care about setting up for life (building credit, getting proper insurance, finding personal doctors/agents) because you don’t plan on being around later? I’ve never really planned ahead of time in my life (I’m almost 23) because I’ve always been suicidal and just assumed I wouldn’t make it very far. Whenever I talk to my friends/family about not preparing for adult life, they get so upset and try to teach me stuff. Then I’ll say “it doesn’t matter, I won’t be around much longer, since I’m planning on suicide y’know” and they don’t even care! They’ll be all “okay, well, if that doesn’t happen, how are you going to buy a house? You need to build credit!” I’m just upset with how much they seem to not care. If I actually attempted, I’m sure they would be shocked. Not like I told them I’d do it right to their faces. Is it wrong for me to avoid building credit because I’m suicidal? I don’t know if it actually matters that much.",1
"Marimba is a really weird instrument. It reminds me of the jungle, the rain, old games with 8-bit soundtracks, and being in freezing cold band halls anxiously waiting to audition. The only thing I don’t really understand is why. Why do I feel like this? Why am I so attached to an instrument that has only ever felt weird to play. The only reason I ever played marimba was to get attention from my parents because my older brother had done so well and literally got in the newspaper because of it. Freshman goes to state for music on the first try. Everyone knew my brother and sister and they would shove it in my face. That’s why I played marimba, because it seems like everything I do, no matter what that thing is, I end up fifteen steps behind my older brother.",1
"People tell me to stop comparing myself to others then immediately do just that. I cut myself because it was a temporary release for my emotions and instead of my family offering me help, they just got mad. More disappointment. More stress. Why is it that I have to cut myself for them to hear me, to see me? I tried killing myself about a month or two ago because I felt so bad. Being known as the disgrace of the family all because of my grades. My father told me that he thought I was the smartest out of all of his kids, but I was wasting that exponentially by not doing my work. Even now, I’m supposed to be working but no. I’m sitting in my bed whilst listening to Tchaikovsky and Chopin (whom I hate right now, as his piano pieces are too hard and fast, or the complete opposite and slow/ easy which upsets me to great lengths). Anyways, the obvious solution to this would be staying on task and finding my own thing that I like, but in the process of copying my elder siblings, I have essentially become a watered down version of them. Like a dollar tree version. All the same interests, none of the talents. It’s gotten to the point where I’m so stressed out that I can’t focus. I always have to have something in my hands or I freak out (ex: I can’t walk in the hallway without a heavily beaded bracelet or an ID because then I focus on either too little or too much) and I don’t sleep nearly as much anymore. I’ve become a slight germaphobe (not letting people sit on my bed or touch me or my food in any way and vise versa), I get 5 hours of sleep each night tops, accompanied by sleep paralysis. I eat once or twice a day, and I’m always extremely tired with random bursts of energy like 3 times a day which I’m starting to believe are manic episodes, but I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything so I can’t say for sure. I have xenomelia in my left leg, and I can’t even explain why. THAT accompanied by my mother saying that I should get a fresh start and switch over to another school is absolutely tearing me apart. Why? Back to the band thing.
I live a life of hobbies and mellifluous pastimes, and when I put them together, the puzzle pieces don’t fit. The world reciprocates in some ways, and in other ways, it does absolutely nothing, because the world moves on while I sit in this black sap that is my grades, expectations, and social life. I often look at this quote - “A star died to make you and you find no romance in that”. It makes me question things quite a bit. It’s weird to think about. At first, it might make you feel special. “A star died to make me? Wow!”, but then you may realize that stars died to make everyone. The quote is supposed to make you feel significant, special, but then you realize that everyone around was also created from stars just as you were. It plays in uniqueness. Adults tell you all the time that there’s only one of you, nobody else is like you, and that you are a unique individual capable of whatever you can possibly put your mind to in whatever moment it is. That’s true. You are unique, and you are capable of doing whatever your heart desires if you try hard enough. With the right intentions and planned calculations, anything is possible. The thing that’s wrong with that is that it applies to everyone. The fact that everyone is unique simultaneously makes everyone the exact opposite of that. We are all, at heart, the same. Look around yourself next time you’re in public. Everyone has a life. Everyone has their own story. The world doesn’t revolve around you, the opposite applies. Almost everyone on this Earth has had their own dreams and ambitions at some point.

"I feel as if the people who were supposed to guide me to these places, my parents, my siblings, and my friends haven’t all been the best influences on me. I compare my family to other families quite often. Families where their parents treat them like friends instead of trophy objects to show off on Facebook and Instagram. Parents that tell them ""Good job! I'm so proud of you!"" on their report cards instead of asking them if they think they can get into college with their lowest grade being an 86. I think I would cry if my parents said that they’re proud of me, even once. All that I want is some sort of sign from them that I’m doing okay as some form of self-validation so that I can feel like I’m not working my ass off for nothing. It’s small things that other people take for granted.",1

I should've worked harder, gotten into a better college. I feel like I disappointed everyone around me. Constantly.

God damn it man. This morning (before I even clocked in he almost made me late) this customer was looking for some tea that wasn’t on the shelves. I tried explaining to him that VENDORS come into the store to stock it, they aren’t our workers and that isn’t our product. We don’t stock that product. I have no way of knowing when it’ll be in stock, if we have any “in the back”, or whatever.

And THEN I pull one of my coworkers over (whose been here for 30+ years) and he tells the idiot the SAME FUCKING THING I TOLD HIM. ITS NOT OUR STOCK. and then he’s totally and happy.

currently my only motivation to not kill myself is the fact that im halfway through major exams so i dont want to affect my 2 friends and that there is a possibility i can get a nose piercing after the exams which ends in about two weeks time. i wouldnt mind though if i get run over walking to school. (i dont know how to use tone tags but im half joking and half serious because yes i want to die but nose piercing sounds cool but also nose piercing means i have to take care of it over a period of time which means staying alive longer which sucks so hmm…),1

Last night Dale promised me he loved me, he was going to leave his girlfriend, and we have future plans for a better life and a better world. He endlessly told me how I was such a genuine and good person, that I had a beautiful soul and I was gorgeous and loving. He told me today he's staying with his girlfriend, he is not going to pay me back, and that he just used me to get back at her. I plan on telling my boyfriend that I cheated, telling my best friend that I had been talking to Dale even though she hates him.

"I am so exhausted of this. Just when I think I can finally rest, just when I think maybe things are starting to settle, another hurdle comes flying at me. This month alone we found out my mum could be dying, my girlfriend left me, my parents revealed that they wanted a divorce, my grandad was hospitalised again and just now my little sister's been rushed to A&amp;E with possible brain damage. If there is a god up there they must fucking hate me. it is like life is trying to get me to kill myself and honestly I think I would be better off dead. I attempted when I was 12 but I was stupid and there was no way I could cut deep enough.

I feel like the world hates me and I have no idea what I did wrong to deserve this. I thought I was getting better. I was doing so well and now everything's just come crashing down again. I was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning but I highly doubt there is any way for me to get that. it is looking like I will overdose but that is unreliable as fuck and surviving sounds like hell so idk. Just got to stick around long enough to make sure my sister's alright. I have already contacted one of my ex's friends to make sure they are looked after when I am gone. I do not think there is long left for me. Sorry.

"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day",1

"It sounds quite stupid, I know. For the last couple of days, I have prepared everything I need (I will not bring the details, but it is a very elaborate plan) except one: a note. I started brainstorming and drafting what is useless and what is not, decided whether to post or write by hand, and checked for grammar. But I felt like even my last piece of writing, however short, was not good enough. Nothing I do is ever good enough. that is how it has always been. I want to perfect something in my life and end myself in a grand finale. Yet, I do not know. Perhaps I can give it another few days. Today is a new one. I am planning to end it all, but as a writer, I keep editing my suicide note",1

"I am f21. i know it is pathetic to ask for help but i just want to talk and at least have a bit of hope that the future will be differentthe last days have been though and idk how it got to this, now i want to kill myself. i could talk to my friends but i do not want to worry them without actually trying it, they have their lives and my problems feel just too stupid to put that burden on someone else's mind. i do not want to bother anyone.i do not know if this kind of posts is allowed here but all i see are hotlines from other countries and not mine (Venezuela) so I do not know what else to do. i just want to feel better and talk to someone that can offer some kind advice, that would be nice :)i do not really want to kill myself but i feel it is the only way of getting rid of all my problems i just want to talk to somebody",1
"If I fail, there is no more hope left for me, in this shitty life. it is going to be my 3rd attempt this year, so I am seriously messed up and ready to go. Previously I gave up because it was too cold and I want to die in the wilderness. This time I am better prepared. I do not have much more strenght to mask my emotions. 1 week then I gtfo I give myself 1 week to find a new job",1
My life has always been a mess but now I am at a point where I do not have much energy left to go on any further. Every second is tormenting me. I have made several mistakes that threw what is been left of me and my life completely off the rails and now I am devastated. I do not have any perspectives whatsoever and self hate eats me. What can I do? Nothing is fun anymore and I have no one. It gets worse everyday. People are trying to help me and they really do see what I am saying but they do not know how to help me either and they are professionals. I am in mental hospitals most of the time but it does not help. I do not know what to do anymore I feel horrible,1
"I have given up on life. I hate my emotionally abusive parents. I wish they just fucking divorced. they are always arguing over literally everything, they are always fucking insulting me every fucking day. they are also overcontrolling af, treating me like a fucking object and making me literally feel like I am physically and mentally suffocating every day. I feel empty,useless and hopeless every fucking day. I wish i was aborted. I am in uni, but i have no fucking clue what I want to do with my life, and I do not have anywhere near enough money to move out.Fucking sucks having to pretend to friends that I am fine, when in reality I am constantly bawling my eyes out everyday because I think about killing myself everyday.I wake up everyday wishing I died in my sleep.I have tried so fucking hard to fight my depression. But it literally has destroyed me. I have got no fight left in me. Life just is not meant to be for me. I have had enough",1
"Yes. It is necessary. However it is not a cure and does not fix everything. It does not fix trauma or trust issues when they are deeply ingrained because nearly everyone in your life abused and betrayed you. It does not fix depression. Coping mechanisms only go so far. You go to therapy, you talk about it, they give you coping mechanisms that trauma, depression and anxiety supersedes. And you have to trick yourself into having a positive mindset to the point where it is toxic or invalidating or bypassing very real issues sometimes. I hate it. If you do not have love, support or an environment that is not triggering then sometimes therapy is not enough. A recent K-pop star attempted suicide and all I see in the comments are: Get therapy. She needs professional help. The presence of a therapist is only temporary. Even if they are a good one. What about being home alone with your thoughts, trust issues and depression? What about feeling like you need to be held all the time? there is no medium for that. For Christ's sakes. I am so sick of people telling people to get therapy.",1
"Than having to live my life. The negative outweigh the positives. The highs are not worth it.it is been like this for years. I have not become stronger, I am still the same. And still, nobody gives a fuck, because everyone is got problems.Why? Death seems a better option",1
I have horrible ocd (pureo) and it constantly bothers me. I cannot be happy for more than 10 mins a day. I am miserable. I cannot even kill myself because people would miss me. I wish I could kill myself,1
"had a lot of little half assed attempts i did not really start or go far enough through, but i did last night. the other time was when i ODd at 16was suffocating for an hour but i could not pass out just crying a lot at one point and writing out my thoughts. my neck and shoulders hurt a lot and i keep feeling tingly and dizzy at points. i really wanted to go to the ER but it is scary, you know?i have therapy later but i do not know if I will tell him. a lot of awful stuff has been going on. do not know if i can talk about any of it though. it is not like he can help me. he would probably have me shipped off somewhere where I will lose all my rights and probably be mistreated at best, but likely molested and abused at worst. and then i will not be able to get top surgery anymore because I am too cwazywish i could get like. some kind of medication to get me through these shit things but i just get treated like a druggie for wanting something more intensive than shit SSRIstexts someone sent me today are just sending me even more over the edge. nobody understands attempt #2",1

I do not know if talking can help, but I do not think it can. It never does. I am alive but not living",1
"// general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying ""what?"" five times in a row because my hearing is going.But the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be. I want to make something of myself but I just, I cannot. I have nothing to put on my resume, I cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not! And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know! Why do not I already know basic crap! Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out? If I brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out! that is it! I cannot do anything else for the day, I am too tired! there is no way I could work or get a job like this! I would burn out after one task and get fired! I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best. I hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc. Of course they would not accept me!! What the hell was I thinking!! What kind of idiot would expect anything different!! Things are not going to get better for the NPD community, not in my life time atleast! Well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. Imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something I could not. Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go. And they can all finally live their lives. I wish I was not such a narc so I could just find peace in death",1

"I have been so disconnected with the world, my family, and myself for the past few years. I do not know what my face looks like. I see it in a mirror but cannot picture that is actually me.

"I feel like nothing everyday, I wake up and ask why am I alive and why did not I die in my sleep? I mean almost nothing to most members but of society so if I offd myself people would forget about me after using my name for publicity after 3 days.When you die people only care then use your name for clout.Tired of living a life I did not ask for, I have no goals, no motivation. I live in a bum ass town encompassed in a shitty county with no opportunities. People tell me no excuses but, I do not care I am not as strong as everybody. And being a man they expect you to suck it up and hold it in. But in reality I just rather off myself or die in my sleep. On the edge and probably about to write my final note.",1

"Content warning: Please do not read this post if you are suicidal/prone to suicidal thoughts. I do not want to trigger a negative spiral for anyone else.I am 19M from Turkey. My family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues, I have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me. I have a very sensitive temperament, am very neurotic and introverted. I am somewhat bright academically (not a genius, but significantly above average), have no hobbies or social life. Ever since the age of 13, I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me, and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime, and even if I want to migrate, I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too, but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious, believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression, though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless, because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is, I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections, only to deduce thata) my need for approval is making me unattractiveb) I am not good/attractive/sociable enough for women to take notice of me, want meOf course nobody tells those to my face, they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs, psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating, intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I, too, can see that this is all just a competition; but some of us (me included) are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists, how they talk about ""everyone is trying to get the best deal they can"" and ""you may be miserable as an 8, since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you."" Dating is a market; and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1% as a maleI know suicide, if done right, would be the same as falling asleep, just not to wake up. I know painless ways, and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience, and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love, and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled (and mind you; I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparent)I am going to wait for my therapy sessions. I just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away. And it will not. I may decide on killing myself a year later if I feel the same way, and things did not change I am considering suicide",1
"I have been through hell and back just to be myself, lost my (extremely abusive) birth family in the process (who never accepted that they had a daughter instead of a son anyway), accidentally found out about a ton of memories from my childhood, and I just do not want to be in all this pain. I cannot work bc my stupid brain does not function properly, especially around other people, and I am running out of food. I started therapy, but idk how long it will take to get better and I am just hurting so much. I should not have to deal with all this pain just bc I was born in the wrong body and to the wrong family, it is just not fair. it does not feel like things will get better for me",1
"i have not been suicidal for awhile, a good 3-4 months! I am still living with my parents, and my mom keeps all pills (&amp; other things i could use to hurt myself) in her room. she fills up a pill container for a few days, no more than 4 at a time. and will not let me take more atarax which i need throughout the day, so i have to ask her continuously. she also does not think i should take much, even though the safe amount is way more than i take everyday.basically, i do not get why I am trying if nothing is changing. i attempted my worst attempt about a year ago, I am about 5 months clean from self harm and am not suicidal! when does the trust come back? i understand she is scared, that is valid. but i will not grow at all if I am kept under lock &amp; key forever. why am i trying",1

Why am I so stupid? I fell for someone who cannot love me back. Loving him hurts so much but I do not know how to stop. I know he will not be in my life forever and when he starts college I will not have much chance to see him anymore. I really do not want us to just slowly drift apart and stop talking. I do not want to be alone. I already have nothing to live for and if hes gone as well there will not be anything worth staying alive for. I hate myself for loving someone,1
"Throwaway account because God forbid anyone who actually knows me sees this.I am just tired and it does not even feel worth it anymore. It just feels so futile and hopeless to stay alive.I was diagnosed with adhd, depression, and binge eating disorder in February, I am on medication and yet I am still fucking up a lot. I am still late for work on occasion, I am still having a hard time getting things done around the apartment, I keep telling myself that I will do good things like cook healthy food and wake up and take walks and wash my face ""from this point forward"" but it never happens or I do it for a day or 2 and cannot keep it up.Before, I thought what my family said was true and I am just lazy but I cannot function without medication. And what is the point of living a life where I need medication and I am still having trouble getting it together anyway? I would rather be dead than wasting air and people's time.

"I feel worthless and nowhere near a man. I feel weak and think that I would be better off dead. I have messed up relationships and family relationships by doing dumb shit and saying things I should not have said. I have been forgiven for my actions, but I know thing will not ever be the same again. I have always been that burden and I just hate myself. I do not even know what I want to do with my life. I went to college and could not even go through my first semester and dropped out. I am in student debt because of that. Then I went to the military and realized I could not do it. I just feel like me being here is pointless. I do not know what to do and I am scared for my future. I know my family is disappointed in me for the military thing, but they just hide it. My girlfriend has been here through the whole ride and has supported me, but I feel like my luck will run out with her soon. I do not know why she has not left me yet. I know she loves me, but she deserves better if I am being honest. I just want to end it, but something is holding me here and I do not know what it is. I know people go through worse things and I do not mean to bitch, but all this pain is building up. I do not know who to talk to about suicide and I do not want to seem like I am going crazy. Any advice or help ? If you are reading this, I am glad you are still here I do not know why I am still here",1
I just do not want to be alive anymore. The constant hurt and pain is too much to bare. I do not know what the point is anymore. I really do not. Life feels dark and empty. I do not have the strength or the will to be here anymore.I wake up and feel like I cannot breath a deep sadness washes over me.an emptiness.a black hole within.How can I live feeling like this? Its only going to get worse. what is the point?,1
"When I was younger, in my childhood, I had self worth, I still had anxiety, but I felt like I was the best at everything. I was a ""gifted"" child and did well in school, in fact my only main source of anxiety was if my crush liked me back. Either way I felt special and unique. I have had worrying behavior before where I would cut myself with school scissors and even younger as a toddler, I would bang my head against the wall or floor. Still. Those things were rare of me though maybe I should I have taken it as a sign of things to come. In middle school I was anxious but I still felt nice and special. 9th grade was when things changed though, I started to get bullied which made me reevaluate myself, I started seeing myself in a negative light, and the only way I coped was sleep or being in a constant state of self loathing. There were times I made threats to the students that were bullying me, but instead of thinking it was wrong, I doubted my capabilities to go through with the threat. After 9th grade I felt better going to another high school, I was not getting bullied, and even though I was not quickly making friends, people still let me hang around them or sit at their table. It was nice. I met my ex boyfriend not too long after and we stayed together for 3 years. He ended up leaving me during my first semester of college. I felt sad about it, but having been in a relationship for 3 years gave me a false sense of security that finding another relationship might be easy. I was quite wrong. Not only that but I started to realize many people were better than me and were skilled at something while I realized I was not. I was quite literally not good at anything or at least not good enough. However, this world requires you to contribute something to it. I could not. The former gifted child felt lied to. That I could do anything and I had great potential. It bothered me a lot. I did not feel like I could conquer anything like I used to. Instead, I was smacked in the face with the truth that I was not special and my best was not good enough. Through this period people kept telling me to keep trying and I eventually will get good. I did not see any improvement, in some areas I felt like I was getting worse. Right now I am stuck with the feeling of inferiority and suicidal thoughts. I am not quite doing anything for this world, in a way I feel like I am taking up space that could be used for a much more skilled and intelligent individual. Recently I looked through documents of tests that were done when I was younger in elementary school. I found that I lacked critical thinking skills and had a language disorder as well as anxiety. I thought my IQ may have been better but I tested below average for verbal iq and only slightly above average for non verbal with the highest in calculating. Right now I am not sure how to move forward... but I am too scared to kill myself. I have never been good enough. .",1

"I do not really want to commit suicide. Walking through it in my head and visualizing being in the moment where I take my life is really unpleasant. I think some of us just want to be somewhere far from ""here"". Without overwhelming thoughts and problems that never end, with people or at the least someone that is a true friend.

It hurts me to say this, it has hurt me so much when I questioned myself about it in the past, but I have to accept it. I cannot be around children with out a sexual thought coming in my mind, for some sort of desire, even if it is something I find so repulsive and wrong, to come. I just need to accept that I am disgusting and that I am probably better off dead than a danger to children. I truly do not think I have a future if I am going to have these desires towards youth.

"I often feel the only way to make people take my depression and possible underlying causes seriously is to actually kill myself. Especially family, who I feel are supportive in some ways but downplay my depression. They do not take it seriosuly when I say I cannot handle work and life. A certain family member is the worst- stating before that I just get a little down sometimes (that phrase still makes me want to punch a wall)or that he notices others inc himself feeling depressed in winter or that he had trouble keeping a job when he was younger. He gives terrible advice that just makes me angry do not feel you cannot take a vacation. That does not solve the problem of the actual job! I am sick of being minimized.I feel (and maybe I am wrong) its just minimizing my condition. I mean hes supportive in other ways. But I am still angry and I feel killing myself is the only way to win the argument I feel, having failed at anything in life the only I can have the final word or any control is to kill my self - successfully. A failed attempt will only make me more of a failure. I mean I know there has to be a better way to deal with this I just do not know how. Confrontation will not help, Ill just sound more desperate. Staying my true feelings about everything to everyone will not help Ill just embarrass and maybe isolate myself more. I can discuss with a counsellor but that often just feels like talking. Its not an solution its not even leading to one. People only take action, especially irreversible violent action, seriously.

"Everytime I go on this subreddit, I cannot help but feel like I am just being a whiny brat. Everyone else has some truly terrible things that happened to them. I can understand why they want to do something like this, but me? I just dealt with bullies all throughout elementary school and was molested for a bit when I was ten. I should still be functional by all accounts.And yet, I am starting to fail out of school because I was a lazy shit all throughout the year who panicked at the prospect of talking to people and slept all day. I am just wasting everyone is time and money at this point. I do not really know why I am still here. Maybe it is time to quit before I can disappoint anyone else even more than I already have. I already know I am not going to see my late twenties, so why not end early? Overreactions",1
God this world is just fucked with the economy making it so hard for poor people to become wealthy and terrible rich people staying rich by garbage companies that we cannot stop supporting because we need their products I do not want to become an adult and have to live in this cesspool and no major political people do shit because they are shit I cannot do shit because I am a failure AH FUCK MAN. the longer I go the more I come to reality that maybe this is it Ill just have to get over it and become another worker in a society that does not care and instead idolizes human garbage. do what you love and enjoy life while I do not hate people who say that and instead wish them the best for wanting to do what they love its just impossible to do what you enjoy without having this huge fucking wall that stops you because ironically you need money to do. We have a whole planet to explore and even the whole solar system and other major discoveries waiting to be found and yet were stopped by stupid people that cannot get over the fact that someone is not the same race sexuality or gender as them. And here I am on Reddit ranting about a dogshit world because that is all I can do its too difficult to have a voice in this world so all I can do is post on a subreddit that probably will not even get noticed. Fuck this world man This world is so shit but we cannot do anything about it,1

Do you regret not committing suicide? For all the people who wanted to kill themselves but never did it. Did your life improved?,1
"life is boring, I am not doing anything interesting, or memorable whatsoever. sucks that my first year of highschool was wasted too. tbh this whole thing has taken over my life because when anything little goes wrong i think abt killing myself and i think abt sh and all that very often and I am literally never happy anymore. also sucks that my parents are not understanding at all so not like i could tell them (believed stupid sh lie and my mom was denying it like not my daughter and i have no way of getting help and i know people get trauma from going to mental facilities so i know i cannot tell anyone so I am kind of stuck staying miserable lol like a dead end and I have accepted the fact that I am just a lesson for people who did not see my signs or whatever (not really blaming them for not seeing them tho lol) honestly i know I am wasting my teen years away",1

"It is almost time for my final tour. It kind of reminds of when I inititially tried to do this vacation almost 18 months ago. I was supposed to go on this trip in March of 2020. I was to leave on a Saturday, and on Friday I had to cancel because everything, including the hotels shut down. I had to cancel the day before my trip, actually day of, as I was on the phone for that long trying to cancel and recoup everything. Now, here I am, about to head on the tour I was supposed to have, and 2 days before I am about to leave, all mandates are back on. I am not against this at all. It is just funny, that the eve I am about to go again, and all things are on the verge of being cancelled. I waited till everything opened, to make sure I could do everything, and what do I get for my patience. The eve before I am to go, mandates back on.I think I said this in the first post, but regardless of whether this trip happens or not, I am killing myself. And if I cannot go, it makes sense, since it will be exactly how my entire life has been, with dissapointment. If I can go, I guess I can just sit in my hotel room alot. Go out get food, to bring back to my room, and eat it cold. Makes sense actually. Fits my life.So close, but never quite there. If I go, if I do not, by the end of August, I would say read my obituary, but there will not be one, or if there is, it will just be, he lived... and now he is not. I cannot begin to tell you how angry, unhappy and frustrated this news makes me. Maybe a good time would get me out of my funk, bit its just more dissapointment. Think I would be used to it by now. This one just stings me alot more. My whole body feels empty now. it is like, you know when you are really hungry, and you stomach feels like it is sucking inside you, my whole body feels like that. My arms, legs, toes, fingertips. Everything on me feels empty, and it is a weird and uncomfortable sensation. I am almost tingling, but not good tingling, tingling that is excruciating. And it is not painful. it is all in my head.Fuck my life man. Fuck my fucking life. Forever unhappy .04",1

The world is collapsing and I want to collapse with it. I want to see the world burn. I just hope there are no humans on Earth. Covid should mutate and wipe out every human on this planet. Collapsing the society is the only way to save the planet. I asked my mother why she brought me into this cruel world. She said, ""If I did not have kids then the society would shame me.""",1
"I have daydreamed about suicide every day since I was 12. I started getting depressed at way younger than that, but I would say the fantasies started around middle school. Back when I was in school I would zone out in class and make all Fs because I was constantly daydreaming. It went all through middle and high school and now that I am an adult with a job I do it at work to. Imagining the goriest death for myself. All throughout my youth I would use chatrooms and forums dedicated to people planning to commit suicide. I really thought I would not make it to 16, but here I am at 21. Ending my own life is the only real dream or goal I have ever consistently had. What am I waiting on? How old am I supposed to be when I do it? I just hope its not much longer What am I waiting for?",1
Every time I mention that I want to kill myself or that I want to die to people that are close to me I am always met with the there are better days ahead! Think of all the things you have not experienced. I do not know but a part of me just does not care. Like yeah there are beautiful places to explore and countries I have not yet been to butat the end of the daytheyre just countries? they are just places? they are justexperiences? I do not know how to explain it. Its just I do not care anymore. The only thing that is holding me back is my family. And maybe that makes me care but I just do not care about myself. I have not cared about myself for so long and it makes me not care about dying or anything that happens in my life. I just do not want to live. I wish I never existed. there is nothing I want to live for,1

"I am tired of people saying, oh, do not die, your life matters! My life has never mattered and in the long run it never will. I work for $8 an hour and all of my friends have moved away. I am single as fuck and I always have been. When I meet new people I put on a smile and fake it, but I am not enjoying hearing about how popular others are, how much money they are making, their amazing careers and no sign of the existentialism that plagues me every day of my miserable life. It must feel good to be like everyone else.I am at my cousins house and she is happily married with an amazing job that pays six figures and she has tons of friends. If I could have a fraction of that life... All I wanted to do was be an artist, and I cannot even do that now. The magic has faded for me. People tell me its not worth it and I should be chasing the money in STEM, where I can do art on the side. I wish they would shut up. I have never had a stroke of good luck in my life and since I was 17 I wished I would die. Seven years later and nothing is better. I hope in the next seven years that I will not exist anymore. The worst part is that I am too chicken to kill myself.None of us really matter in the long run. In 100 years, nobody will remember who you are.",1

"Is there anyone on this sub-reddit who ran from their problems? When you were younger and then it overwhelmed you until you became suicidal? My biggest regret is not facing my fears and problems. Like if I would have dealt with my problems when I was younger, I would be OK with my life. I never did until now, but the consequences of running is almost impossible to live with. I do not want to die without trying to win; I might not have enough time to have a life that satisfies me. If anyone can relate, I would like to read about it. Running from problems",1
i adopted a kitten hoping if i could live for something and something could live for me id be happy but I am so sad.. so so sad. i told everyone it made me happy (they helped pay for them)but it did not i just feel more stressed out i cannot see a away out of this i have to take care of them now i cannot leave them or anything I have always been like this i cannot see a future were i could be happy. i just spewing my sadness out i doubt anyone comes to this place. i thought getting a kitten would make me happy,1
"I am 23, virgin, dropped out of college, most likely will end up dropping out of my diploma that I sought for 5 years (depression really makes it impossible to concentrate) basically I am a failure in every singe way imaginable.My parents kept telling me to kill myself and how much of a worthless burden I am everyday ever since I was 12 and even knowing it probably was not true (it is now though) a part of me did believe it and it just kind of adda up.I have been thinking about suicide everyday, when I am bored I fantasize about dying and I cannot take it anymore. My parents think I am lazy, good for nothing and will probably kick me out on the streets soon.My head literally hurts, I often feel a tight knit in my chest and I have lost my appetite for a few months. I have also lost two cats in a short span of time because I was weak myself (could not afford a doctor and parents to save a few bucks took them to a cheap back alley doctor). I truly did love the cats more than anything and would have done absolutely anything in my pathetic power. They trusted me, loved me more than my scumbag parents and guess what, they are dead.I feel like a walking destructive force that will destroy anything and everything around me including myself (but clearly not enough). I am also afraid of holding others back and hurting them, wasting their time on my miserable self.When the fuck does it get better? I have been listening to it for a decade, can it even get better? it is such snake oil bullshit. I cannot even kill myself because either it is painful, too complicated or involves potentially traumatizing others (like jumping in front of a train).How do people live such hollow husk of lives? Can someone suggest an easy enough way to end my life? I would strangle myself as a baby if I could I just want to fucking disappear. I am so sorry, I just feel so helpless and think I have managed to fuck my life up beyond repair. It does not get better does it?",1
I do not know. I am too tired to type a long paragraph. I want loosing weight to be over with. I can feel the fat all over my body. The feeling of so much food in my stomach feels disgusting and dirty. I just want the cycle to stop and I want to hit the goal weight I have been trying to reach for 3 years. I was 4 pounds away and now I just feel disgusting. If I binge one more time I am killing myself.,1

"Fuck I wish I was not so much of a damn coward about it, so many times I wish I could get it over with.Just do not really want to put my mom through that, also do not want to risk my school loans being dumped on her--do not entirely trust that my own death would be the end of it.I always chastise myself about feeling like this, that my stupid issues are not anything compared to the suffering many go through.Yet that logic goes out the window when stress causes my anxiety to feel like it is ripping and clawing at my throat. That for everything I try to do to actually be useful to others almost always seems to backfire one way or another, like a constant reminder that I am always going to be worthless, that it is the punishment I deserve for even being born.That it is my own fault for even trying in the first place. Or my own fault for not being able to ignore the pain in my back and knees more so I could push myself to just fucking do better. I mean why should I care if I ruin my body now? I barely expected myself to make it this far, to live this long. I mean eventually even cowardice will reach its own breaking point I imagine. Constant reminders of failure and uselessness ramming against the dam will because it to shatter at some point. A meaningless existence like mine is surely destined to fizzle out soon enough. I just wish my death would not be as much of a burden as my life has been.How nice it would be to just pop away, to erase my debts and traces of my life as if I was never here to begin with. I know so many people fear the very idea of the end. But at this point I am either numb to the aspect of it or almost in a way dream of that time finally coming. I mean I could remember a time dreaming of what it might be like to finally be better, to find the joy and wonders of life--which I mean I can appreciate and all, but there is also this sort of tarnish that constantly smudges everything when you have to live like this. That nothing can ever be good for too long. That things that bring you down have to roll over again and again until you just stop fighting and just become the punching bag that everything seems to zero in on. And maybe that is what the idea of death inviting in it is own way. That once you enter that dark abyss there just is not anything anymore. No terrible things to constantly remind you of how worthless you are, no good things that always perks up that joy and hope no matter how in vain you know it is, just waiting for them to be ripped away again like they always are.Just a peaceful empty where I can fade away into nothing, where I can stop being a burden to everyone around me. But until then I guess I will just have to stick to dreaming. A mistake of a life",1
are not your teen years supposed to be more interesting? feels like I am wasting them lmao life is so boring,1
I do not know why but whenever I try to get better I always find more self destructive habits and find new things about myself that I am disgusted and disappointed by and I would have killed myself by now if it was not for knowing what guilt I would leave with my family but now I am thinking that it is the only way out of this sick and disgusting world I guess I am Here again,1

"This evening, like 2 hours ago, I planned my suicide. I planned where I was going to do it, and a few days ago I planned the day that i was going to do it (this friday). But almost 30 minutes ago after I washed my face and cleaned my hair, i feel amazing about myself. This happens EVERY DAY. I get really suicidal because I loose my plans for the future, and because I am very self conscious about my looks, to the point where I have tried to cut my nose to make it look better (but failed). This lasts for about 90 percent of the day, but then at around 10 percent of the day (usually occurring at night) I feel like I am beautifal and that I feel amazing about myself (but I still do not see my future for myself as I lost most of my hopes and hobbies but that does not make me feel any less worst during those times of the day). I have been diagnosed with depression before, but I lied to my therapist because I did not want to get in trouble with my parents and told her I was ok, so in her and my parents eyes it looks to me that I am getting a ton better, (they think I am doing better because I get hella good grades and the best grades out of all my siblings despite having depression) but I am not. My suicidal tendencies have gotten worst this month, and this month I have gotten EXTREME low self esteem from seeing others on social media. Does anyone know what is going on?

"I am currently in the middle of my mom and aunts talking about the new covid variant and how there is going to be more lockdowns and schools are going to stay closed and they are all seemingly fine with it. Meanwhile, I am over here freaking out because this is my trigger. I have gone through so much during 2020 and even though I am a relatively strong person, I have relapsed into depression, active suicidal ideation, and self harm as well as terrible sleep schedules (I average on 4 hours a night). I literally cannot do this anymore and I know Ill freak and do something irreversible if I need to be isolated again. The best part is that all of this makes me feel super selfish and guilty because it feels like I am prioritizing my happiness over other peoples lives. Anyone else going through the same? I cannot go through another quarantine",1
"I was a normal good looking guy/teen.Not bragging not like I was a playa or anything but my looks was not a concern. I had active social life and would do things without thinking going parties, nights out, friends etc.Of course lockdown now but this been a few years.In early 20s I notice my hair falling out. I started using sun beds and tanning without suncream because I thought it I go bald I need look dark as white people look sick when bald.My idea was to burn my skin so it is permanently dark.Fast forward a few years not only is my once luxiourios long thick hair half disappeared my face looks like a burns victim. I stopped the sun bathing due to this this my skin is white anyway the irony but all saggy and scarred qnd aged. Fant even hide it with my long hair as I have no long hair so my face is fully visible now. So Combine this with my thin receding hair I have gone from looking like a boy band teen to I am going to some hideous creature.When we people take pics when I have to go out work or family etc restarts they always upload pics without me. The ones with me do not go on Facebook etc...it is obvious they do not want my fuked up face on social media and I do not blame them.Now the issue as a result before covid I avoid everything. No spontaneous life anymore. Going out for 2 or 3 days in a row. Random parties or nights out. I just became a recluse.I need to always carry or wear a hat i couosnt dare sleep over some place now. I live in constant fear over my looks.I hoped lockdown would make me feel less missing out as everyone same boat and time to avoid sun use creams fix my skin improve diet hope hair improve.But over 18 months my hair is worse and face not look any better.Well nobody is going out anyway with covid round here but I still feel my life is fuked because I had it all.I looked normal and had social fun life now I am just constant obsessing and looking mirror qns almost crying.I cannot even look mirror anymore to soul destroying only in dim lights.I cannot believe only some years ago my skin was perfect and hair amazing long.Of course hair loss can happen but I see people grandparents with still nice skin so that is all my stupid fault qnd cannot improve it.Depresses me every day.I eat well workout in good shape I gueas etc but all seems pointless Is it stupid to be suicidal due to appearance",1
"I have been trying to understand what that compulsion is I felt when I wanted to die. I know this is a tricky question because it would be so deeply personal and individual to everyone, but I am curious if anyone can lucidly explain everything going on during this moment.For me all I remember was there was many terrible things happening to me and I was trying to just go about my regular day and as I was travelling in my wheelchair I stopped. My head was telling me that I needed to drive onto the highway and go in front of the trucks that we are approaching.I just froze and sat in that feeling and those thoughts crying trying to understand what it all was. I had idolised about death and thought about it a lot but that was the first moment where my instincts were telling me to go and do it there and then.Is this similar to everyone else? Just a spiralling of terrible thoughts and Realisations leading to the strong desire to die? Or are there other nuances to it? What is in that moment?",1
"All my life my family has been toxic and I have always suffered from depression and severe anxiety.. I started cutting around the time I entered middle schoolI turned 19 a month ago but for the past 3 years everything has gotten worse. My older sister emotionally and verbally abuses me and my family. She used to say once I turned 18 she would fight me, I thought about killing myself just to avoid everything. But I did not and now I am 19. I do not want to really get into details but believe me when I say the past 3 years have been hell I am exhaustedmy sister would threaten our lives and her own. Using everything she could against us. We kicked her out many times but she let us herself back in. The police have been to my house thousands of times. I know she struggles with mental issues and she is in pain too but now I am exhausted and my depression and anxiety have worsened. I have recently turned to drugs I am abusing them so badly everyday I get high if I can drink Ill get wasted I have also recently started having sneaky links to feel something. The first time I cried while doing stuff because I know its wrong but I also just do not care.I am self destructing and the worst thing is I am witnessing myself do it and I cannot stop it. I have become so numb to the world around meand when I am actually happy I feel guilty because I know my mom and the kids are sad with the situation.I have wanted to move out but if I do I am leaving them behind to deal with my sisterwell I guess either way Id be leaving them.I do not want to die but I am tired of waking up to this numb feeling. I have medication but I think need something stronger now. Lately I have been having cutting urges.

I end up in the same old place every time.I feel terrible about myself. I just want to drop out of college and give up on my dreams. I am not as great as the others, so what is the point in proceeding. Sure, I make good grades, but I do not have any great skill or talents. Everyone around me is so much better than I am, and there is me. Unlike everyone else who is worth something, I am about as valuable as a speck of dust just there to be thrown away. I might as well give up on my dreams. It probably was not important anyways.I just want to give up. I want to give up on everything. I do not Know How Much More I Can Take It.",1
"So I posted to a group where me and my friends chat about how if I was gone for a long period without talking (2 weeks since I am quite active there) that I was probably dead. The reason being my parents want us to move to the country side with no internet beacause they are conspiracy theorists and such and the internet is basically my only support. And I honestly could not talk to them about my problems and they no way would not move to the country side even if I pleaded on my knees and I honestly do not think I would want to live anymore at that pointI have anger issues and when I get quite angry I have the urge to take a knife and stab myself in the throat and I am quite open about this to my family of course they take it as a joke a little goof a gag a punchline. So they never take it seriously to be honest if we did move I would probably stab myself to death or at least drown myself I could not stand moving so far away from my dreams ambitions and friends like that and at that point I do not see a reason to live my life is already screwed up so I do not see a reason to stay at that point So back to my friends I told them straight up if I am gone for 2 weeks no talking, that I probably killed myself. I wanted them to know this since I did not like the idea of them never knowing what happened to me since I know if i was in they are position that I would want to know why someone so active just stopped posting and I left for bed I came back tomorrow and only one of them said anything out of the 4 friends 1 of them ignored me (maybe did not see the message but be were never all that close) and the other 2 had not posted so I assume they were offline The one that responded did not know how to react and when I checked recently they were panicking asking if anyone saw me online and that they were worried about me and I do not know how to respond staying silent would be a dick move I do not want to make them upset Y'know but at the same time I do not know what to say I cannot promise that I will not kill myself it is the truth I would buy do not like seeing the upset but I do not want them to live on thinking I am okay I am honestly confused I am only 13 and I honestly cannot think of what to say to them. Any ideas? I need some advice",1

Whenever I make conversation I slip up all the time, I do not click with ANYBODY. I make it awkward, I get looks, not just from strangers, but from my family. I feel like I cannot even tell my feelings to my boyfriend anymore. I am selfish for that. Nobody includes me in things. I am a nuisance ever since I moved homes, I am in the living room, on the couch, I am a living burden. I am genuinely convinced that if I put a bullet through my brain my family would throw a party. I am literally useless and my only redeeming quality is draws good and where will that get me? Suicide. I fucking hate myself. And I am seriously considering it. Seriously. I am convinced thoroughly that I am just a nuisance, a burden, a waste of space and air and oxygen and that I am just nothing in the world. I hope my family drives me instead of continuing to fake loving me. I hope they get mad at me enough. Just tell me you want me dead. Tell me you hate everything about me. what is even the point anymore?",1
"I am 31 and live in a very abusive home where my family tells mr how worthless I am everyday.I got verbally abused every day of my life and I am trying to sort my paper work out and get a good job and move out.I cannot get a job right now,but when I can I am getting to jobs and getting the hell out.There one of the biggest reasons I am miserable and it is here or I go homeless since nobody in my family wants to help me or cares about me.So it is stay here until I save up or go homeless and never find another job,but I am going to hurt myself if I keep staying here I want out I want help I am tired of suffering everyday I want this to end I need help.Please someone help me. I do not know what to do about my life.",1
"I take care of my whole family. I do everything despite being diagnosed with an incurable illness.No one fucking cares. And the whole ""stay no do not kill yourself because people around you will miss you and be heartbroken"" yeah I am fucking sure they would, then they would not have anyone to be the goddamn adult despite being the youngest. They would not have anyone to take care of them. that is what they would miss. And maybe they should. I have told them countless times how I feel. They do not care. Maybe they deserve to be heartbroken. I do not deserve to suffer so why should I stay? Fuck this. See you next time. I am not enough to observe",1
"Before I start, I promise I will show this and my other suicide notes to my therapist whenever I see them. I have been suffering from mental health illnesses for years (was diagnosed 6 years ago). I hate it. I genuinely hate it. I have to take meds to boost serotonin levels (store-bought serotonin as I call them). On my birthday in June, I told myself I will end things an year from then (provided things do not get better). I am 24 and am yet to do achieve anything significant (unlike my parents, siblings, close friends and connections on LinkedIn). Turning 24 recently is really hitting me hard. I graduated university at 21 and have done internships (a local bank, a Big 4 firm consulting firm and startups) every now and then. My last paid internship ended before the summer of 2020. I am yet to secure a full-time paid job since, unlike my peers who are pretty successful in the corporate world (i.e. they are getting promoted or moving to international offices say London, UK). But, then, there is me. I have wasted the last 3 years of my life. I could have learnt a new language. I could have learnt new software (say PowerBI). I could have been studying towards a professional qualification (say CFA, CAPM etc.). I could have lost weight and gained muscle. My ex left me at 21 because of me being suicidal and unstable back then. But, my untreated mental illnesses do not let me too. I messed up the final two years at university (relative to my first year performance which was stellar). At all of my internships, I was extremely slow with tasks i.e. making PPT slides, replying to emails (I believe I have undiagnosed psychomotor retardation). In my daily life, I avoid doing a lot of chores, for instance, doing the dishes, folding my laundry, cooking, reading a book. It takes me 30ish minutes to do the dishes (something that would take my sibling 15 minutes). It takes me 7 minutes to read a page of a novel. Taking that into account, it would take me 2 months to finish a 300 page novel. Because of how slow I am, I have gotten very dumb too (I struggle with basic mental maths and avoid doing things that require a lot of brain power). I am not even sure if therapy would help me. I am scared of entering the corporate world or pursuing a masters. Because of how slow and dumb I am and how stressed I get in pressured situations. I point fingers towards my untreated mental illnesses. At times, I wish I had cancer or something similar to show people around me that I was actually struggling. Even though, I told myself I will commit suicide a day after my birthday next year in June. If things do not get better (i.e. I do not land a full-time job and not be as slow as I am today). However, I feel like ending things this Saturday. My method of suicide would be jumping off a bridge (near a major public hospital) and getting hit by an incoming vehicle once I jump. Or, I will overdose on my meds. But, very likely, that will be next June. Whenever I hear of people dying on the news or from other sources, I say ""Lucky them. I wish it was me instead of them."" I always pray I die in my sleep. But, here, I fucking am. I know things will not get better (there is too many things to work on and fix). I am better off dying, either naturally or via suicide. I am currently working on launching a non-profit startup, centered around mental health. In that case, it will further motivate everyone involved in case I end up killing myself. Turning 24 has really hit me. It feels like I have run out of time to achieve things......it is too hard to turn things around. If you have made it this far, I appreciate you reading of my struggles and my suicidal thoughts. I have had enough (In tears as I type this)",1
Every time I go through a cycle of happiness and depression it just keeps getting worse. I cannot keep going on like this for the rest of my life. I just want to be better but my mind says no. I do not know how to help myself anymore. This is the first time I have considered suicide in my life because I am so scared about going through these emotions again and again until I die. My head hurts so much from crying I want it to stop. Does the cycle ever stop?,1
"Tell me I am wrong, but you cannot. You know its true, either you let the pandemic kill you or you be proactive and beat the pandemic to it. I wish the CDC and WHO would be intellectually honest and just admit there is no way life is worth living anymore and that they just recommend suicide already. Every day I stay alive I am supplied more and more proof the only escape from this pandemic is suicide.",1
"I think I am useless and I tried to kill myself on a concoction took 22 1mg Xanax as well as 150mg tramadol 25mg diphenhydramine 150mg seroquel and lucky my older brother found me slumped and unresponsive where he called 911 and told them I was breathing strangely then I was taken to the hospital where they found a whole lotta drugs I had taken and for some reason the ER doctor told my brother that that the marijuana they found in my system was very serious really??? This mans never touched weed before I assume anyway they found benzos because I took my whole script of Xanax and have no recollection of it this was after I blacked out after taking benedryl and then I woke up the next morning with bandages from an iv and my parents were not happy though I do not live with them I woke up in my childhood bedrooom please do not mess with benzos they are extremely dangerous when my brother found me unconscious I was chocking on my own spit he turned me onto my side but I am grateful for what he did and now I realize how precious life is I was always depressed and found no point in life but this all changed and I hope somebody found this helpful I was near death and thank god my brother had a weird feeling to come check on me, most likely saved my life. Overdosed today and suddenly had weird glimpses of my mother and my girlfriend crying and missing me",1
"i feel like I am losing my best friend, she does not seem the same around me anymore and avoids affection (which usually she is very affectionate so that rlly worries me lol) idk hwat to do,,,, if i lose her i will have no future bc my future was supposed to b with her,, i want to kill myself help",1
"I left my job recently, where i found out my boss was seducing his teenage employees; a couple years ago I dropped out of college because I was having severe mental issues like depression, delusions, hearing shit in my head, bad relationships; had quite a few shitty jobs that treated me like shit; abandonment issues from friendships and family relationships through the years... idk it is all just coming forth in my mind all at onceI cannot get myself to see a therapist because I do not want to start another relationship with someone and try to dig into shit when I just want immediate solutions. I do not see a future for myself, everyone fucking hates me and gives nothing in return... I ask for help... nothing. And now my career is fucking ruined from my last job... I cannot even work in the same field, which is what I have been doing all my working life, otherwise I have meltdowns just thinking about itI'm even engaged, but I just feel like such a fucking burden.I think I am just ready. it is time to go. There are much better people out in the world that are more capable than me, I am just another one to stop the chain of depressed alcoholic addicts in the food chain. Good riddance I have never actually committed to the idea of actually following through, until earlier this week",1
"I had group therapy for the first time today. It sucked, I quit immediately. There are not any in person one on one therapists here. Not only that, I do not even really know what to do to get better. Or if I want to get better in the first place. My biggest problem, that I am Non-binary, is not even fixable. Outcast amongst outcasts, it is got to be the most hated minority since even other trans people hate on us. Not to mention other LGBT people and obviously everyone else. I read that like 87% of people would not even date a trans person, so I am assuming the numbers even higher for nonbinary people. Which makes everything very isolating. There is no way in the world I could even date in my current state, but even if I could I would never find anyone nearby. I thought the first step would be going to therapy, but that is over. I looked up the ones that take my insurance and there is like 4 in this area, 0 of which offer in person. And then even if we pretend everything else was solved, I still have no way to support myself. No way I can work because everything makes me want to kill myself, no way to go back to school because I am poor. No interests or passions at all besides making art. There is not a single *valid* reason why I should not kill myself. If I had a gun or heroin I would not think twice Nothing left for me here",1
Literally nobody wants to be my friend I am going to overdose. Getting rejected,1
"So, my birthday is coming up soon, and just like every year, I am dreading it. it is one of the worst days of the year for me. it is also one of the days that I think about dying the most. Not necessarily through suicide but by any means, like, freak accidents, accidental overdose, just anything that will end my life. Nothing ever happens, but sometimes it makes me wonder what would happen if I did die. How would it affect my loved ones?Has anyone ever lost someone close on that person's birthday, and how did the passing of this person affect you and the other people close to him/her? I am mainly looking for people who died by their own choice, but if it was due to other causes you can still comment. I, like many others here, want the pain to end but do not know if I can go through with it if it will hurt those around me.please only post if you feel comfortable. Ending it on a birthday",1
"I am supposed to be going on vacation tomorrow around 4-5am but I do not see a point in going. Maybe I can beg my grandma to let me stay home and I can do the deed when no ones home. I know my grandma says she cares but she verbally/Emotionally/mentally abuses me. it is either I kill myself or I wait for my physically/verbally abusive brother to lash out one day and do it for me. I have pills here and I am considering ending it. I just do not want to leave the puppies alone. I cannot even be myself. I am non binary and my whole family it seems is against all non binary people. Maybe I can wait another 2 months. Wait for school to start and see if I will give life another chance. I am sorry for the rant. I do not know what the point of this was. No one loves me, how can i love myself?",1
"Not encouraging suicide or publicly disclosing the method, but just saying I personally am all set to go. I will probably live a week or two more. Goodbye cruel, cruel world. Found a good painless method",1
started therapy two weeks ago it literally feels like talking at a wall I have never felt less heard. i do not know what to do anymore there is no light at the end of the tunnel what the fuck am i living for nothing helps,1
"Around the first of July, I unintentionally overdosed on fent pills. Now all I can think about is the relief I can have from not being alive. Everyday I wake up wishing the Perc would take me, I have been clean for a while but man a couple drinks and a perc so I could finally end this consistent suffering that is my mental health. Overdosed of the percs",1
"no one would care. everyone probably already wants me gone. I am just worthless. life is pointless anyway. I am not going anywhere. i already do nothing for everyone and that probably will not change. as far as i know I am more of a burden than i think i am. everyone would probably say they care but it never feels like they do. it just feels like they say it so that they do not feel bad, but they do not think about me. and here i am complaining about it on a site where probably no one else cares about me, just wasting time and doing nothing to solve my problems. honestly just waiting for someone to tell me to kill myself, or maybe i will just do it anyway. death happens anyway. might as well spare everyone the trouble and get rid of myself before i make everyone else more miserable. should i just kill myself?",1
"I am a 17 yo guy and I have been struggling with depression, derealization and paranoia ever since I was 12. On top of that I now have GAD.I have been wanting to kill myself since I was 12 because at 12 yo I started having episodes of derealization caused by the paranoia that everything is a dream or fake.I have somewhat gotten over that, but all that has been replaced by depression and anxiety which caused me to fail 2 years of school. I hate myself for letting that happen.When school is on, every day I think of suicide and have really bad suicidal depressive mental breakdowns every night.Right now it is summer break, but I cannot take all that pressure again. Sadly, dropping out is not an option for me.I also hate myself because of my height. I am only 5'8/172cm tall and I live in a country where the male average height is 5'11/182cm. That makes me feel really inferior, weak and pathetic because most guys I know are taller than me.I think I feel bad about my height because I am secretly competitive so I have been feeling my whole life like growing taller is a competition.Just for the record, I am already in therapy and on antipsychotics and antidepressants. Also been in a psych ward 7 times. All that has not helped.Nothing helps. I think I am going to kill myself on the 31st of August. I think I am going to kill myself",1
"I have squandered most of my opportunities in life and i feel like a loser because I am. I was a high school athlete and I was a very social person growing up. Now, just turning 30 I have dropped out of college/university twice and only have a diploma in music production which makes me extremely overwhelmed and anxious anytime I even attempt to make anything. I was in Human resources last year and missed one course on my final semester so i never graduated. I hated the curriculum anyways... bunch of cucklord social justice bs... I am kind of at the end of my ropes now though. I am 30 years old and feel like a huge loser. I moved back in with my parents who are constantly trying to get me to move out again and telling me to go take school or another program that i have no idea if I should take or not. Life is slowly falling apart around me. My parents are getting older and life feels like it is getting worse every day. I am in Canada and cannot even buy a gun to die. Part of me does not want to die because I do not want to fuck up everyone else's lives around me but nothing seems to help me get better. I am starting to lose faith in myself and my ability to move forward. The only friends who i occasionally talk to drink alcohol all day and smoke weed/play video games. They are complete losers. I used to do shit like this but I do not want to do this shit anymore. I feel like I have no idea how to get better. I am tired and exhausted and things just are not enjoyable. Medication also does not seem to work for me. I get bad anxiety on antidepressants and yea... I also used to experiment with a lot of mdma and smoke a ton of pot over 5 -10 years ago when i was first in University and I think that might have fucked me up as well. Life just sucks man... I legit have no clue wtf to do anymore. I am 30 and probably should be taking a job working at starbucks... fuck. I wish i had some support and any advice for someone on how i can turn my life around.... Fuck... I have also tried stopping watching porn and doing that and I think that definitely helps. I really hope life gets better for me. I have a hard time even trusting any people anymore because I have had some fucked up experiences with other crazy people who used me and took advantage of me. I am not sure i can recover I feel like I have squandered all my opportunities in life and I am ready to die. Just turned 30 and life seems pretty pointless for me now",1
Going to delete testing it I am still allowed on this sub Testing testing yeah yeah,1
I have been extremely sad and disappointed in life for months and its never been this bad. When I was a freshman I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and even then it has never been as this bad. Never. I have never struggled this much. Nothing even triggered it. I just do not understand it. I am deeply sad and so unsatisfied with life rn. I have been thinking of suicide for a while but I have stayed alive bc i keep thinking and hoping it will get better. I have never struggled this much but oh my god it is not getting better. Please tell me you understand,1
My abusive bf makes me wish my suicide attempt a year ago worked. He is the most disgustingly cruel person to me ever since I caught him sneaking around behind my back. He is not at all the person I began this relationship with. I want out and every time I try to leave I cannot and it makes me go back to the feeling a year ago when I saw killing myself as the only way out of this constant abuse. I want out,1
"I am starting spravato (nasal spray esketamine) on Monday. I have heard there is some pretty great results, but I have also had over 50 courses of ECT as a teenager (i mean hell, I am only 19 now) and that did not have much benefit. In fact, the only lasting effect was intense memory issues. I cannot remember my childhood at all. I am so miserable every single day. The normal treatments just do not work for me. I have got social anxiety and do not have a true friend. The only person there for me is me. If this treatment does not work, I am going to kill myself and I need to mentally prepare for that. I am not going to make it to 20. My suicide is inevitable. I am scared of death but it is inevitable, so therefore I do not think suicide would be a bad idea, I am just scared. if this treatment does not work, I am going to kill myself",1
Its definitely an over reaction but its my only solution to any of my problems. I could literally make the smallest mistake and my only thoughts afterward are that i should just kill myself,1

"I am so frustrated all the time. I just cannot do anything. I feel incapable of the most basic of tasks, and also of my dreams. I am so sick of it. I feel an urge to die all the time. Literally always. And it feels inevitable to me that I will give in eventually. I am so scared of death, but life feels bad to me most of the time. An interesting title",1
"I am slowly realizing that life just was not made for me, suicide seems inevitable. I do not want to die peacefully though, I need my death to be exciting and an adrenaline rush. Maybe something like jumping out a plane with bombs attached to me, or maybe a heist gone wrong. It sounds like a better experience than slitting my wrists. Anybody else want to go out with a bang?",1
"every day i constantly am searching for things to distract myself, anything, from the constant feeling of guilt for not killing myself. i feel like a constant burden and disappointment to everyone i know and I am losing my mind. i have to hide that I am nonbinary and suicidal to everyone in my life and its fucking killing me inside my boyfriend tries to help but i cannot tell him what I am thinking because he might blame himself or try to help me on his own and i do not want to put that burden on him. i just want to die I am tired of the constant guilt and the thought of jumping out of every moving car I am in or jumping from the nearest windows to me every fucking day i cannot do this",1
"358 days ago I made my last post. And here I am again. If I had known I was going to wind up back in this place, I would have just killed myself back then. It gets better is a lie. It does not get better. Nobody gives a fuck. I am sitting here with a bottle of whiskey and all the pills in my house. I am alone. I am afraid. I hope it does not hurt. I hope it works. I hope there is no hell that is any worse than this life. Fucking adios. If I would have known it was going to end this way, I would have killed myself a year ago.",1
What makes it worse is she is white and I am mixed (black &amp; white). Like think about how I fucking feel about my mom freely using the N word out loud (yes the entire word with ER on the end. Ugh I just cannot take it anymore. Every time she has said that I just get a stabbing pain in my chest like how can she do that with mixed kids who are half black. My mom just says the N word to insult someone,1
"I just need to get this out, I just lost my job of three years I have been depressed for a long time and I just want to die, it is to much. Every day it is a new pain, every waking hours I am searching for a new distraction, it is just getting to hard to keep going. life is getting to hard",1
"I have never attempted suicide but over the last few months my life has become so overwhelming that its now a constant thought. My grandfather committed suicide when my mom was 10 years old which affected me in two ways. 1) I actually understand how painful it is for the people you leave behind, that is why I said I have never attempted it even though I have thought about it many many times, and 2) everyone in my family believes its hereditary and gets overly concerned when I am in a mood. It makes it impossible to talk to anyone close to me about my own thoughts of suicide because I feel like they will take it almost too seriously. I know that does not make sense but I actually hate when people feel sorry for me. So I bottle up my depression and lash out at the people I love. In a perverse way I almost wish they all hated me so that it would make it easier to leave them. The logical part of my brain says my life will turn around and the depression will subside - that is just how life is. Its just incredibly painful right now. Before anyone suggests I go see a therapist or get on medication, I have seriously thought about it but unfortunately my depression is currently stemming from the fact that my business failed, I am in a black hole of debt and I cannot afford health insurance. Money troubles - it does not get more cliche than that. I do not care if anyone reads this or responds I just found it incredibly therapeutic to finally vent all of this. This subreddit helped just to see that my situation is not unique and were all humans dealing with our own circumstances. there is probably someone in our life that is going through their own version of hell and well never know about it and there is definitely at least one person in our lives that deeply cares about us whether we recognize it or not. To all the people battling with depression, recognize it for what it is, and do not give up the fight. And to all the supportive members here I want you to know that you are making a difference. Venting",1

I have experienced a lot of life. A lot of bad life especially. Drugs. Mental illness. Broken family life. Years of therapy. I even found the love of my life but I know I cannot make him happy. he is miserable and I bring him down everyday. He deserves better and I cannot give him better. My mom also died of covid 19 recently. I downloaded this as a last stitch effort to connect with ANYONE in the entire world who can help me or just talk to me without bias. I saw this while looking up ways to kill myself and thought fuck it. Why not. What could the rush be. Why not see if a single person has anything to say to me to change my mind. Going to kill myself soon.,1
"There are noises all around her, but the silence is louder. From the ground, she watchesthe kids ready to take flight on the swings, the dogs leaping into the air, the birds circling the tops of the trees. she is searching for something. Her eyes dart back and forth, unable to rest until they find whatever it is she is looking for. People come and go until she is the only one left. Its getting cold. The silence is deafening as she approaches the playground. There is a ladder, but she will not use itthat would be too easy. Instead, she scales the outer walls and pulls herself up and onto the slanted roof of the structure until she is at its highest point: On top of the world, and surrounded by fences. She stands, closing her eyes (so they do not have to), and let us the silence consume her. Freak Accident [OC]",1
"Talking about things does not seem to help, it only seems to worsens things. I do not have much motivation to talk or ask for help, Because they will always say the same things. I think about this every day. I am just waiting until I can find the opportunities it seems.I cannot even imagine what could possibly help. I really do not want any help. I do not want anyone elses idea of happiness. If anything, I want to express this, so I am posting this. Pointless",1
Idk why but in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral. Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I have been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I do not want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly do not know what to do at this rate. The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately.,1
Count down to the end. No longer coping.,1

"Five days ago I decided that I am going to do it today. I had it all planned out and wrote a note and all.I promised my best friend that I will go to a roadtrip with him. Then I wanted to have some time to cuddle with my girlfriend and then go to work and do it. I work as a night receptionist so I thought it would give me enough time and space to clear my mind and get myself to do it.And I keep climbing to the roof, and I cannot do it... I keep trying, saying no and going back to reception in order to cry uncontrollably for 5 mins and then just continue working for another 35. If I found some new meaning in life I would be happy but everything seems as fucking desperate as it was. I do not feel like I am any better than I was, I do not deserve nor want to be here any more than 5 days ago when I planned it out.So at this point I am just venting because i do not know what is happening. I want to jump but I cannot make myself do it. I feel stuck in this limbo or whatever it is. I thought I was going to do it today",1
"I am currently in a living situation that is far from ideal and becoming unbearable. I need to move out, but I feel immense guilt and concern because of how much I am needed here. Ill start by explaining my relationship with my family. Older brother (X): My mom and I immigrated from Cuba when I was 4 years old. I am now 21. We had to leave X behind (we are 11 years apart), and he did not come to the US until I was 16. Because of the cost of communication and our extreme poverty throughout those years, X and I did not get to know each other at all. When he came, he felt like a stranger that I was expected to love because of our blood relation. From the ages of 16-21, he has engaged with my body in sexual manners without my consent (grabbing my ass, slapping my ass, getting on top of me, removing my clothing, forcefully entering the bathroom when I am showering, and looking at me naked, etc.). No one is aware of this except my therapist. I should mention that he is an alcoholic, and some of these instances occurred when he was under the influence. About 2 years ago he moved out with his girlfriend, but they recently broke up so he moved back home. I am now living with him again. Younger brother (Y): Y and I are also strangely enough 11 years apart but on the other end. He is such an impeccable human. He is my best friend. Watching him grow up has been the most fulfilling experience of my life. Unfortunately, the responsibility is too much. His dad passed away when he was young so it was only him, my mom, and I until 2016 when X moved to the US and joined us. My mom had to work a lot, and I was relied on to take care of my Y. This had an extreme effect on my education, extracurricular, social life, and mental health. I did not sign up to become a parent. Apart from financial support, Y relies on me for everything. My mom relies on me for everything. Mom: This is, of course, the most complex relationship I have. However, I will not go into as much detail. She treats me like a child, does not allow me to see friends, constantly making homophobic remarks (does not know I am gay), constantly offending my expression or lack thereof, does not support any of my decisions, forces me to shave armpits and legs because it is gross and is unladylike, cannot talk to her because everything turns into an argument.... the list truly never ends. - But she needs me to take care of Y, translate every document, upkeep the house, etc. I understand her pain and suffering. She has been through so much. And I know she truly does need me. This is why I am still here. I am needed. I am afraid of what will happen to them without me. But I am tired! Of being used, disrespected, neglected, uncomfortable, abused... I am so exhausted. I need to focus on my life. I need to prioritize myself- but I cannot. I am stuck. We are all currently living in a small 2 bedroom house. My mom is sleeping in the living room while Y and I share a room and X has his own. I am in college but because of the pandemic, I am staying here. I probably will be taking the upcoming semester off because its too difficult to do school here. A few weeks ago I was suicidal, and I almost did it, but I realized that the reason I wanted to kill myself was also the reason that I could not. I am in therapy for severe depression and learning how to socialize. I also experience derealization often. I do not know what I want to receive. I just needed to release. Thank you for listening. I was suicidal, and I almost did it, but I realized that the reason I wanted to kill myself was also the reason that I could not.",1
Some days i want to just end it all because it feels like nobody would actually care. All my friends just dropped me. My boyfriend does not understand my trama and bland me when i have a breakdown. And i just want to die. I do not feel anything but the urge to kill myself rn Some days,1

"Been waking up everyday with really no hope, I have been told also that I have syphilis. I do not really want treatment and hope it just kills me. Nobody really wants me around, they just try to make me feel better by pretending to care. I live in a shitty neighborhood where I am constantly living in fear with a bipolar dad that dishes out his criticism and disappointment on me. I am worn out, like before I was working out and working, but it hit me. What am I doing this for if I have nothing to really cherish anyway? I am always thinking about others but I am always getting the back end of shit. I am fucking exhausted, I am tired of not being able to hold a job, because I cannot get along with anyone. I am tired of being ignored in situations where I am trying to excel. I am tired of being disrespected. I am tired of feeling so anxious to even be apart of society. I am tired of thinking there is a future for me when in realty I am so fucked I am better off dead. I get shitted on everyday for who I am, how am I suppose to be happy at all? I am tired of searching through these fucking hook up apps just to find some damn friends. I am fucking tired. Had my 26th birthday on the 26th, and did not really celebrate life is so dull now.",1

"I have been depressed for long time, and whenever I seem to get a boost in happiness I get reminded of the current world. The rich are getting richer by exploitation, the rich are going to space while people are eating out of garbage cans and sleeping on benches.I am most terrified of climate change. we are not doing anything about it. And the blame is always put on us rather than companies.I do not know how anyone is happy in this world but the rich. I am terrified of the future.",1
"As the title says, I have been going bald for the past few years and it is made my life a living hell without a shred of hope. it is started when I was around 16.5-17 (24 now) and basically my life had stopped ever since. I need to mention I am using the common medications for hair loss, and though I have had nice results for some time, my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worse.I am so lonley, have no social life since I am ashamed to go outside, have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman, and it is all because of this malicious curse. I would trade absolutely everything I have to have a normal head of hair, like a guy my age should have. I would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance. I know the hair is not my only problem, but it is most definitely the core of all the other ones.I was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as I am still trying to fight for my life, hopeful to make an appointment, and although the guy there said it is still too early for me (does not mean It looks anywhere near decent) he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when I had last visited the clinic, and I looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what I have now. In fact, I was once a pretty handsome guy (though never appreciated it), but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old, sad and ugly to a point of no return.In that point of time it really does not matter whether I actually end my life or not, because I feel like I am already dead. Actually, I do not even feel like I am human anymore, just a pathetic, useless piece of rubbish. Having ""better days"" is actually the worst thing, because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse. My youth has been taken away from me and I feel doomed to be lonley and hating my appearance for the rest of my life.I have no idea what is the point of this post, but anyway, thank you for reading and have a nice rest of the week. Going bald is slowly killing me",1

I can never succeed in anything I put my mind to whatsoever. There is no hope for that. None. I cannot wait to end it What is the point if you work your ass off and still fail everytime",1

"Hi, I do not know why I am writing this here or anywhere at all, but I feel like a mess and do not know what to do and pheraps someone here can help me.I cannot say I have ever struggled in life, I had everything I needed to this day, my parents always suported me even when I probablt disnt deserve it, I have a social life and friends even tho I am not very social, I feel like I have every thing One would need to live right. However I do not feel good about myself, have not felt since around 7 grade. Even tho I had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future. I never tried my best in school even tho I was fully aware that I needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life, to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me. I ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows, I saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something, and there I was left behind with no purpose whatsoever. I started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself, purpose, value, right and wrong, it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion, things I had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what I now know as nihilism. I started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless, talking to people seemed meaningless to me, i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so I would not have to think about living and life in general, the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color. And that when it hit me, why do I have to live like this? All this thoughts, lonelyness, zero purpose, crying nights, what reason do I have to stay? Suicide made its home in my head from there on but I still feared deaths, there were a few times where I grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking, can I do this? What if this? What if that? I never could bring myself to do it and I always ended up cryng over how I cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle. After sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend, the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity I felt I was. The relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption, everytime she went out to party I was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks, i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night. With time and her icentive i went to college as well, my parents had to getMoney from the bank to pay for it but i felt like I was getting out of my hole, fjnnaly a light at the end of the tunnel. But it was not like that, today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life, even tho my parents made the biggest effort I still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose. And now I feel slowly faling back into that hole, I even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to ""live"" and still lack pupose. I try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism. Lately I have been feeling like a lost case, i suicide has been on my mind lately as well, i just do not know what to do, I still fear death and the worst part is that I had EVERYTHING and I messed up, i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward, i feel miserable, a failiure, and a waste of effort that was put on me. I am sorry for the long text and the bad english but I dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what I felt for at least on time in my life, thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going, oportunities will arise but please take them, make it worth it do not be like me. I do not know what to do",1

"I have had anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember and from last year it is been really bad. Now this year is just pushing me over the edge. First my grandpa died then my dad got so sick he could have died and needed an emergency operation and he will need one more in a few months. Then my cat got really sick and she is still sick and I am trying so hard to get her better but I am failing. Then an animal at work that I have been really close to died while under my care. I have a partner but no friends and animals are my heart and soul. People generally repulse me. So, people might think that pet problems would not effect someone very much, but for me it totally stops my life and takes me over.The anxiety about my dad being OK is just on my mind constantly and the fact that the animal at work died under my care makes me feel so horrible and useless, I could not save him.. what the he will am I even there for then? And then my loving, lovely cat that I cannot help.. what the hell am I here for then? I wish she could just get better and I could get sick instead. I would give my life for her wellbeing if it was only possible to make the trade. I have not slept in 4 nights because I have been watching over her. And now awaits another sleepless night. And then tomorrow I have to go to work and it is killing me because ill have to leave my cat and I will not be able to watch her and I will just be a ball of anxiety while somehow working.My partner tries to be supportive but she does not really understand and when she jokes and smiles I just feel so alone.The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is how much it would hurt my parents and that I would fail my cat, she would not understand where her mommy went and then she would have to move and get a new mommy and I am responsible for her. But I am starting to feel like I am failing her anyways and someone else could be a better mommy to her and my parents are probably so tired of me and my constant nagging from worrying.Everytime I am driving I am thinking about finding a good brick wall to accelerate in to. I cannot take this any more. The constant sadness, hopelessness, worrying and fear This year has been hell and I just want to leave",1

"So I am in my 30s CPTSD pretty much every single symptom of thatChildhood neglect childhood abuse be molested as a kid and they grew up to be raped and physically abused and drugged I have been beat up by a boyfriend all that crap.So here I am I told my mom last week that I am not going to make it to the end of the year. I am not getting the proper help I can only see counsellor once a week and her advice for that was to find a psychologist that she would pay for once a month..... Last time I was in the hospital they said my CPTSD is critical and I need like the life saving help.So last week told my mom I need something more something impatient something where I can actually heal if you forgive me the right treatment. Her advice was basically stopped being a little bitch and just go back to the 24-hour hold.Then I called her 30 days ago and said I cannot fucking do this I am going to kill myself and I do not want to but I need like intense intervention right now or I am going to lose my fight.Her response was I do not know what to do but should I call the police on you......Now 2 days after which is now today, she calls me and leaves a voicemail cuz I was on the phone with two other lines already like one was I was on hold and the other one was actively like having a conversation. She send s this sulky guilt trippy fake I care about you I really need to know how you are doing' So I actually tried to call back because there is not maybe she wanted to finally help me. 6 hours later she finally picks up and says you know I have friends and people and places to be You do not need to be calling me all the time. And I said yeah like always there is always something before me. And then I told her I figured out the trip that she takes quite often is hours shorter than a drive to me..... So why have not you showed up.She says I do not have an answer I cannot talk to you right now you are always being an hassle and hung upSo in case I was not feeling it desperate as soon as I am before...... I just I got you kitten thinking it could be something to look for. But I am dying I cannot feel it I have not done anything that I just.. You know when your time is coming and I am trying my best to hold on but everybody pries my fingers off. I just need to figure out who I give trust with my cat because she deserves the best and then my time's up Times almost up",1
"I come home from school, lock myself In my room, cut myself up and write suicide notes, then when I finally manage to come out for dinner they get angry at me for not doing my chores and say I am lazy and I am just addicted to my pc, then I have a full on mental breakdown in front of them and that just say its because I am not on my pc because of how addicted I am, its not fair tf am I even supposed to do now Its not fair how little my parents understand me",1
"i do not do anything, things just happen to me. I am powerless. I cannot survive on my own, i cannot leave my house, i do not feed myself, i can barely work for a few hours sitting at a computer before getting exhausted. Exhaustion that makes the chest feel heavy and the eyes drop and I just feel like screaming. I cannot bear the responsibility of being alive, i just exist, I wake up, i look for reasons to get up, cannot find any so I just do because I am expected to, not because I really want it.Its all so taxing, so tiring. ANd to be honest I do not want to get better, I just want to rest. I do not understand where do people draw the strenght to keep waking up everyday voluntarily. Then again I have nothing to cling on. no friends, no future, no goals or ambitions and there is always the temptation and the choice to just quit. I am past the point of wanting friends. I am scared of friendships, I have not have one since middle schoolI m not going to get vaccinated. TPTB do not care about me, so why so suddenly do they want me to get a shot? its in my best interest you say? no, dying is my best interest. I already had covid back in february.

"If I do not get back into my college courses for next year then Ill do it at the end of August, same for if I am not 90-95lbs by the end of August.If I get into college next year, Ill give it 1-2 months to see how its going, if I spend all my breaks in the bathroom or I do not make any friends then Ill kill myself after Halloween.If for some reason I am not super lonely again, Ill see how my grades are by Christmas. If I am failing anything, Ill do it after Christmas so I get at least one last Christmas with my family.If I do not have a job by my brothers birthday, Ill kill myself in January.And if life is still going shit by my birthday next year, Ill kill myself just before/after my 18th.I think that is a pretty decent plan of the next potential year of my life I will kill myself eventually, this is my plan for the next year",1
"The only things my mom can do is provide with the bare minimum which are food, shelter and etc. Other than that she is just terrible, and maybe sometimes she is nice when she is not screaming at me for nothing. I would say she is toxic because she always compares me to others including herself, she is a massive hypocrite who gets mad at me when I do the exact same thing as her, shr hit me as a child and also once when I was 12 byt that is a different story, she cursed at me as a child, she even fighted with her own mom and also with her dad for like half a year after we moved with him and even though she knows I have trouble with selfharm and that I am suicidal (because the psychiatrist had to tell her) she did not change a bit. Still yelling at me for little things and because of one of our daily fights I relapsed after I tried so hard to resist the urges. And I am writing this post right after one of our big fights where I *again* told her that she is not a good mom and that she is not self aware at all. In the end I told her that I did not want the psychiatrist to tell her because I do not trust her, I did not want to tell her that I think I have OCD because I do not trust her, I told her about my almost suicide attempt and that it was right after one of our massive fights, and after all that she says that there is still more life to live, so I am just done. I want to cut so bad right now but I do not want to use a knife again, I want to use a sharo blade but I cannot get one. She is also one of the people that thinks that a positive mindset will make everything better. Well mom, it is kind of hatd to get my grades up when I gave up on school and life. I hate my mom",1

My bf and I have been going through a rough patch and I am pretty sure he wants me to leave him alone so he can move on. I told him I am having suicidal thoughts not as a way of manipulating him just trying to communicate what I am going through and he made me feel so terrible. I am already ashamed for feeling this way and he said he does not know what I want him to do with this information. I feel so alone and lost. what is the point in life anymore. I feel so ashamed",1

"We broke up. She was my first and will be my last. Never went into relationship before because I knew how much I would fall for the person. I know compromises in a relationship should be for all the good causes of our personal wellbeings. I do not think I am any good but I always encouraged her to be better than me personally, academically and pure from the influence of drugs, booze and people with negative energy and maintain a better social media hygiene etc. Despite all the hurtful things I have endured, all I wanted in return were to influence me in a positive way for me to give up smoking, control myself when got cranky at times etc. so that it becomes a two way street. She meant the world to me. The world where great things would happen. We made so many memories and planned our future together. But in the end I lost her, lost my world and I have nothing left. No reason for me to stay in the world anymore",1

I see straight through everyone, everyone I have known have all been fake, I know they do not care about me. I have cried myself to sleep multiple times this year. I feel like I am the only one going through this even though I am not. I try, and I try to be the best person that I can be, someone who can be accepted by others. I want to die. Whenever I feel an ounce of happiness the pain always comes back to me. I am tired of living.",1
"After unsuccessful attempts I found my final plan for a week from now, I found it ironic that that when a post asked to stop and thing about what I would miss and the only thing I could come up with was the state fair that I went to when I was young. I am not asking for advice or planning to change my mind, but I found it sad that was all I would miss. Id rather not share my story since I have shared it with so many in my life while I was asking for help and going to therapy this whole time and was always ignored or told that I just needed to continue to talk about it. Life was not fun",1
"Hey Reddit, sorry if this is too much but I really do not know where else to turn to so any advice at all would be helpful.One of my closest friends since I was 15 has been going through a lot recently, she is open about her feelings and what has happened to her and has always said she feels like her life is not worth living. We had not talked for a while since 2018 but she reached out last month and we have been hanging out a lot since then.However, she told me that at the beginning of this year she was sexually assaulted by an immediate family member and since then she has been traumatised and has developed PTSD. She told the rest of her family about this when it happened and wanted to press charges against him but they do not hear that as the perpetrator is under the age of 16, and I think this is the main reason as to her feeling this way as she told me she had always been quite close with her mother (who does not want her to press charges). Since then she has been living in a refuge as she cannot stand to be around her family, understandably, but it means that I cannot even try to call emergency services to come to her location as these places do not give out their address (even to the residents).She seems like she will go through with it as I found out she has been spending all of her money on her friends and buying people gifts, which sounds like her because she is an amazing person who has always been there for other people. And now it feels like no matter what I say or do, it is not enough and as someone who has thought the same things as her I understand that completely. She also told one of her friends that she has bought the 'equipment' to commit suicide and is planning on doing it next week (she did not specify which day as she does not want anyone stopping her) as she had tried to get through to her mother again earlier today about pressing charges but to no avail.I have spent a lot of time with her recently as it felt really good seeing her again and catching up after so many years, it is like she never left but she is about to. She reconnected me with one of my old buddies too, but since then told us that it was part of her 'bucket list.' I really do not know what to do I cannot even thin straight so I am trying to ask anyone I know for some advice, the situation she is in is a horrible one which I cannot even fathom so it feels wrong even trying to look for some way to help her as she is so insistent on what she is planning to do.If it helps with the advice, we live in the UK. Any advice or help whatsoever would be so greatly appreciated. My (M21) friend (F21) has been planning to k*ll herself next week and I do not know what to do",1

"note: this is a throwaway account specifically for this subreddit and a couple others of similar topic.----pretty much the only thing keeping me here is musicit's like music knows when you need someone, and it is genuinely the only friend that will not ever leave you behind when it eventually gets bored of you. because it will not get bored of you. music is just there. forever. whenever you need it.whoever invented music is a fucking genius.honestly i do not think i could have survived these 17 years without music. it is been so painful at times and honestly i just feel like crying when i remember everything I have lived through, especially the last 5 years. but i had music. and music got me through it all.because of all of that shit, any criticism i get from anyone hurts way more than it should. but i do not show that of course, because there is no point, as nobody would understand.but that is not the point of this post, i do not want to talk about that stuff here. maybe one day i will make a post about that stuff.my point here is that music is the best, most helpful, most loving, most comforting, most amazing friend in the whole world.and I am scared that one day i will lose interest in music, just like i lost interest in so many other things that i loved. a few years ago, i had some friends who i vented to a little. but they did not understand me like music does. and these friends all ditched me so i stopped venting to people unless i really really trust them. even then they know barely anything about me. yet here i am writing this.i do not even have to vent to music because music already knows and understands everything that you have been through.I am sorry if this makes no sense, I am so tired while writing this so it probably does not make sense.thank you for reading. it means a lot to me. music is the only true friend that will never leave you",1
"I cannot seem to do anything right. I lack awareness on all levels. I am bad at almost everything I do, I am just slow in general. I am 16 and it seems like I am surrounded by smart people even though the only reason it seems that way is because I am just such a moron. I am so self conscious about my intelligence that I can barely focus on anything without constant thoughts about killing myself. I am constantly reminded of my stupidity and I hate it. I am trying to do activities like meditation, yoga, cardio, rubix cubes, and other hobbies to get sharper. but its so hard to keep going because the struggle is way harder for a below average person like myself during mentally demanding activities. I have other problems with myself but there are too many to count. Even physically I cannot stand myself, I feel like a disappointment to my parents every time they look at me. If literally anyone sees this, please try and tell me what I can do to combat this because I am at a loss. Maybe a suggestion to boost myself mentally, because that would give me more self confidence. As I said though I am trying different hobbies, but if you have any testimonials from your own experience or good insights to my kind of situation please comment, I am starting to lose hope.

Due to covid I failed all my classes because I did not have any motivation and was severely depressed. I just want for it to all be over.It feels like nothing in my life is going well. Every time I am happy because I am with friends I zone out and think about all of the things stated above. I just cannot deal with this anymoresidenote: I am sorry if this is hard to read. English is not my first language and I am very bad at talking about how I feel .",1
This is what the government wants poor people to do and THEY WIN. I WILL DO IT FOR THEM. I do not GET TO GO TO SCHOL BECAUSE I am POOR. I am NOT GPING TO LIVE IN DEBT. I GIVE UP I have to do something because I am poor,1

"I posted this in r/depression as well, but I figure this would be more appropriate. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more.I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma.The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships.I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well.TL;DR: I am killing myself in a month and I generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living Killing Myself Soon",1
"Because it is ""too easy to find a gf"" ? No it is not. Maybe for you. Not for me. Not for a lot of people I bet.I will do it anyway. Because as you get older its even harder. what is the point of living if you cannot get anything you want? Why should not I be depressed over being a virgin that cannot find a gf?",1
"I have chronic health problems and pain, i have 2 bad phobias, i have anxiety and ocd symptoms, I am lonely, I am depressed, my mom is dying, I am suicidal.My anxiety and pain is crushing me. I am decaying, I am dying. I am losing the fight.My mom has a really serious illness and she can die any moment and probably will not live long anymore. She is the only person who cares about me, nobody else gives a fuck. She is also depressed and suicidal. She has threatened suicide but said that she is still alive just beacuse of me. She is the best mom ever.We live in the middle of nowhere and covid did not change anything. I have been living in this kind of isolation my whole life. And i have no friends, everyone thinks I am annoying. I am going to a different school now and i know absolutely no one. Its a big school and i was in a really small school. A huge change and facing it alone. I am so damn scared. I am probably going to get bullied beacuse of my appearence. If i get bullied.... I am going to kill myself. I am either anxious or in a neutral mood or i feel a strange mix of numbness and sadness. I cannot enjoy life. I am always thinking about this. I cannot cry even if i wanted.I have never actually got a full on anxiety attack but last night i took a knife and held it to my wrist. I did not do anything, i just sat there for a couple of minutes and then put away the knife. I knew that there was no way i could die, i would just had shredded my tendons and everything and fucked up my hand beacuse that is what usually happens when you slit your wrists. And i really like drawing and a lot of other stuff i need my hands for.As long as my mom lives, i live. If she dies, i die. I cannot live without her. I really cannot.Everytime i think about suicide i get really anxious and i want to cry but i once again cannot.Only thing that keeps me going is writing lyrics and poems and stuff. I really love it, its one of the most important things for me.Sorry if this was unclear or had grammar mistakes, english is not my first language and I am really tired. I..... i fucking.... i do not even know anymore what to say",1
"Ever since the UK had a large country lockdown thing last year, my social life has gotten worse and sometimes I cannot even speak as I do not know what to say.Recently, I have been getting more persistent suicidal thoughts and wanting to self harm. Thankfully, my addiction to the internet has basically saved my life as I have found out what phobias are. Me having a phobia of death and pain really saves me from doing anything to hurt myself. Though, at times I get SERIOUS thoughts, but I try and consider the good things in life and turn to them for help.Another problem is that me and my parents have completely different views on mental health. I think it is looked down upon to be ""mentally unstable"" and it should be talked about more, my mum is a nurse who thinks she knows everything but she most certainly does not, and lastly (the worst of all) my dad. He tells me that I should not cry because its annoying, anxiety is a stupid thing and it is all just a phase, that I am not depressed I am just being a teenager. Speaking of what he says, I am scared of him because he would shout at me all the time when I was little (sometimes It was justified, most of the time it was not) and he tells me that I should be scared - he just does not understand that children are not supposed to be scared of their dads.Sorry this is long but, NEXT. Unfortunately on the subject of suicide, I have attempted to commit suicide. It was a couple months ago when I was in the bath. I was listening to some what I call ""Lucid Dreaming"" sort of music and my family was downstairs watching the TV and nobody had checked on me in a while. Since my mum is always worrying because she knows I struggle with self harm thoughts, I was wondering why she is not shouting up to me asking if I am okay. It kind of just made me feel unwanted as all my family where laughing downstairs whilst this suicidal kid was in a bath by themselves - they could possibly decide to like .. end it all. Suddenly, I was just looking back on all the times I felt empty and I realised how much I was feeling that numb feeling. I just decided to sink beneath the water. It was not until reality set in that I ended up surfacing and thinking it all over. I do not think some people would class this as an ""attempt"" but I think it is.I know this is long, I know I am sorry. I just have a lot to say that I cannot say out loud or I am going to get grief. Some bad things in my life.",1

But I just cannot stand the thought of living him behind g-d its hard sometimes. It really is. If I did not have a dog I would probably kill myself right now,1
Its just miserable and I feel exhausted and like a burden. I am tired of waiting for things to get better. I know I have a lot to be grateful for and there have been some good memories but I have had enough. there is been more despair and pain than moments of happiness. I am afraid that I am losing myself even more as I try to stay here. I am more depressed and cranky and isolated and I do not want people to know me like this. Its tiresome to keep trying to hide the amount of melancholy and desolation that I feel. what is even the point of living if I am not even really living ? I do not want to have a full life span. Id probably contribute the most to society by being dead and donating my organs.Idk why I am still waiting Living feels like a slow form of suicide,1
"I have been extremely sad since last week and I cannot seem to get back to who I was before this. I write, draw, and sing but I feel like, at 26, its too late for me to make something of myself. An internship I was looking forward to is not going to pan out due to covid, my grandma is having major health troubles, I cannot get ahold of my therapist, and to top it off I started self harming yesterday. I have dealt with suicidal ideation and self harming thoughts before but prior to yesterday Id never actually done anything. I am so ashamed and embarrassed. I can usually talk to my mom about everything but I do not want to hurt her or have her think its her fault that I am hurting myself. I have a dog named Sam that I adore. Hes my world and taking care of him is one of my greatest joys. He does not do well when I am out of the room, he cries and cries... I do not want him to miss me if I go and I worry about him looking for me and having a broken heart and not understanding why I left him. I know he would be well taken care of, because my family loves him dearly, but the guilt is almost too much to bear. I feel like a coward for not being able to go through with ending things and I hate how much stress I am putting my family through. I do not know what to do. I do not feel like I am worth having around. I want to give up but I do not think I can. (TW: self-harm)",1
"Whenever I have a bad day its always the first thing to pop into my head, the answer to every problem all at the same time. Some days I get very depressed and I think about it basically all day but for some reason I am still here. Almost every night when I lay in bed its always on my mind keeping me awake. What would happen if I did it? Would people genuinely miss me? Would I ruin my families lives by doing it? Would the memory of me just fade away? Would people genuinely feel sad, or just surprised? The sad reality of it all is that even if I do it, these questions would remain unanswered, which is the hardest part of it all. I romanticize suicide all the time, I have made it my be all end all solution to everything in life...",1

"I am just fee up of everything. Everything and everyone pisses me off and I have tried to be happy but that just does not work. I have made plans of suicide for sometime after i pass my driving test and get a car. Its the only thing i can think of, I have tried self harm but I am too scared of pain, thought about jumping off a building like my brother tried but I am a coward and anything else is too painful or I am scared to do it. I know I have not passed my gcses because i did not try so I probably will not be able to get into college, I am so negative to everyone around me I am scared I am losing friends. Everything about me is just a fucking waste, anyone else could have been born in my place and done better, children are dying in impoverished countries who could have had great potential but people like me were born who are selfish and useless.

I need to FUCKING end it already I am not depressed/suicidal just because of my height, but its a huge part.",1
"How people have treated me about my lack of attractiveness, feeling undatable like the only way I will get to be with someone is if I date someone mentally unstable or disabled. Like that is what my worth is. It makes me suicidal. It makes me feel like my worth is down to who others think I should be with. People do not know what it feels like to be so agonisingly alone constantly day in and out ruthlessly.

I am only 22 but I just want to die. I have no friends and no hope of achieving anything anymore. I watched my older brother die of cancer last month and wish it was me instead of him. The universe is one fucked up place. Death is easy, unless you fucking want it :(",1
"I am tired man. I just do not feel like doing anything anymore. The only thing I actually look forward to is getting high. I am not interested in anything, and to be completely honest, *the very process of learning new things has become a burden to me*. The only thing that keeps me going is that by doing the bare minimum I am able to maintain a lifestyle where all I have to do is show up at work and do a ""good enough"" job and afterwards I can just get high and have a place to go home to. Everything is a burden. Learning how to socialize is a burden. Socializing is in fact the heaviest burden in my life. Everything I just said could be completely directed at simply learning how to socialize and that alone would be reason enough for me to be over and done with life.I am tired of trying to""become"" the ""best version of myself."" I am tired of having to greet people awkwardly over and over again just to get better at it. I am tired of trying to use body language or my own voice in a communicative manner.

I am tired of having to fight all of the automatic negative thoughts whenever I have to interact with another human being.I am never going to what I want out of life because of all this so why even live. My motivation is all gone and I am just not capable of enjoying other people. I would rather just go to sleep forever than have to something.

"I have been having suicidal ideation nearly every day for the past few years and the older I get, the worse it gets. At this point killing myself feels inevitable. I am taking a break from school and my student loans will be due soon which has been making me feel like I have to just do it. My parents took out tens of thousands in parent loans as well and considering I do not have a degree or a well paying job there is no way I could possibly help to pay it back. And how could I ask them to pay for that when they already are only just scraping by? Killing myself has always felt like the way things will end for me as I have a lot of trouble connecting with people and I really do not want to be alone for another fifty plus years. That being said, it has always felt far away. So now with my student loans looming I feel like its probably coming to be time and its freaking me out a bit to be honest. I have no one to discuss this with (my mom yelled at me when I had tried to discuss this with her a few years ago) so I just needed to write this and put it somewhere. Sorry if I have broken any rules of this sub I have never been here before. feels inevitable at this point",1

"Main problems are sharp pains in liver throughout the day constant loss of consciousness for two days after my overdose and my breathing has been a bit more laboured, also wrenching a bit and feeling a bit sick. I am most concerned about the liver pains as they are consistent and actually make me say ouch occasionally and I have a high pain threshold. My liver just does not feel right after this. It was a busy night when I did what I did and I did not feel like a pain to the nurses but probably was to the doctor who could not understand why I was not immediately reacting the way he wanted me to. Well I actually did I just seemed to have a delayed reaction to the drugs I took for whatever reason. I am worried about my liver. I took a pretty high dosage and I do not understand why it took a day to react. Just a couple hours before I was meant to be leaving hospital I started to strongly react to the medication I took. I had all the symptoms. Then I spent the two days immediately after taking the overdose getting all of the worst symptoms. A bit while hospitalised and mostly not. The medication was out of date and there for if i ever needed to kill myself. I would have been smarter doing this a different way because now I have no idea what I have done? Sometimes I do not care then I get a sharp pain in my liver and do not like the idea of dying slowly of cirrhosis. I suppose most people who want to die would rather just take a painless route but those are basically unavailable unless you really know what you are doing. I am having pains after overdose I was hospitalised for a few days ago.",1
I am scared of how they will react if I tried to kill myself. Like would they be angry at me or themselves. Would they be sad. I do not know. I wish I had another reason though. Literally anything. A pet. Something. I do not know My parents are the only thing keeping me alive,1

I am autistic, bpd and intellectual disability, my bf is autistic dyslexic with depression he told me he loves me and bought me a ring to marry him I said yes he wants kids I do to..many people disapprove of this and say I am dating child or I am predator or I should know better. I do not know anymore I do not know what I am and might be best to die so others will be happy. I am not sure what to do so I will be committing suicide soon. I have been suicidal for years.

"I have been experiencing an increasingly hellish hell for many years and I am closely nearing the end of what I have the strength to bear. I have money saved to purchase a few acres of land in another state, but my depression, anxiety, and confusion of navigating the adult world has thus far hindered me in making this long-held dream a reality. Too scared of making a mistake, scared of risk and change, even if it is change for the better, something I know I want deep down. So to stimulate motivation, I have made a pact of life and death with myself; if I fail to aquire a new home by the latest deadline of this upcoming December 31st, I will take my own life by opiate overdose in a motel room on January 5th of next year, probably sometime in the evening. It does not help that I want to die anyway. A death pact is hardly a motivator when you are already suicidal. It seems like ending my own existence would be easier and a more certain win than anything else I have ever done as it seems as though my hopes and dreams are nothing but shattered shards of failure and regret. I want to see beauty in life, a reason to keep living, but darkness is blotting it all out now. I hope things change soon. They have to or I am going to die. If my moving plan is not successful by the end of the year, I am killing myself January 5th, 2022",1
"I have been changing numbers constantly just lately among other stuff I have been doing or not doing due to this feelings that I got during a very toxic relationship, I was doin better before it but the shame and guilt I got out of this just took me many steps back into the dark I used to walk in. I do not really know what I felt, what I am feeling, I just feel I am done. Its weird because during the course of it I felt pity, I felt scared, I felt sorry but mostly ashamed and guilty I still think I could have avoid all of this. I do not have any energy left on me. I used to be a huge player and the fact that I was reminded and worse constantly manipulated and tested and lied to did not help me a lot, yet I still feel this emptiness. Again. Its not the person and my mom blames me she says I am spoiled I do what I want but its not like that. I just want to end it. End all the pain, I cannot take it anymore. I feel like In the past couple of months I have started over and over and over and over from scratch and I cannot stand up again It just hurts so much like either its all my fault or I am just the victim which also somehow makes it even worse, like how stupid I need to be to be usedlike that ?i do not got answers to any of these questions and its been like this all my life. Just different characters to the same twisted plot. I do not know",1
"The thoughts are coming back. I am feeling suicidal again, I do not know how much more I can take. it is happening again",1
"well, for some reason I am still alive but with my body completely sore, I do not know what to think, I cannot stop thinking about the miserable beautiful memories of people who really seemed to love me and it was a lie, I do not understand why it is so difficult to have someone, Maybe if I deserve it, but I am tired of being alone, I no longer think I have a way to redeem myself, and knowing that the person I thought loved me told me that he does not want to know anything more about me only makes me want to jump out of the window, or sleep and dream something impossible with it again Welp, I am still alive",1

"lost my dog on monday, he was always my brother and best friend - my everything. I have spent more time with him on this earth than without him. i love and miss him so, so fucking much already. he was without doubt the best thing that ever happened to me and i would do anything in the world to bring him back. fuck I would do everything to just have one more fucking minute with him. it hurts so much to go to bed without him, to wake up without him. I have been suicidal for years and there were a few times where i was insanely close to ending it all, but now i am for once glad that i did not kill myself. it would have just shortened our time together even more. in all these years I have never felt this much pain before, i just want to hug him and be with him. it breaks my heart not to be able to know whether he is okay, whether he is safe, whether he is alone. i want to be with him so bad, the thought of never being able to hold him in my arms again tears me up insidei cannot kill myself because of my sister, but if it was not for her, I would do it in a heartbeat why do the best ones have to go",1
"I have typed and rewritten this 100 times. Its embarrassing but here goes. Why cannot I kill myself?My life is a long story filled with ups and downs. But since I was a child I had my best friend with me. In highschool he and I started dating and 2 years ago we got married. We had no one but each other. A lot of years were just us vs the world and it felt amazing coming home to him everyday. But then I found out I was pregnant in May. Since then, he completely changed. He has cheated twice now with two different girls. I caught him both times. I have no family, no friends. I lost my job. I told my therapist what is happening and she asked why I am even seeing her still. I stopped going to therapy and I am sick of them not helping. I decided I want to end my life while I am pregnant. I know that sounds macabre and evil, i know. But no one will love the baby but me. I do not want her to grow up feeling as alone and unwanted as me. I decided to do it several days ago. I have my notes (one for my husband one for my mom) written out. Every day for 3 days now I sit down in the bed, take a blood thinner, say goodbye to my cat and lay out the notes. But one I grab the knife I just freeze. I usually stay like that until 3 when i hear my husband pull up and put everything away. This feels like the right thing to do but I just cannot do it. I do not know what to do anymore or what hope I am holding onto. What should I do? Why cannot I do it?",1
"Like its so easy. Take a bunch of pills and everythings over. No more stress, no more pain, no more anxiety, no more being fat. Its just over The temptation to kill myself rn",1
What do you think the easiest way to do it is? Without your raw human survival Instincts to counter it? Cutting your wrists and throat I feel like can back forever a gun pulling away at the last second. How many pills and what kind would you need? Do you need to mix the pills with alcohol? How strong of a rope is needed to hang? How small of a room do you need by sticking your head in the oven? I have failed alot in life this is the one thing I do not want to fail at Struggling with the method,1
24m have been thinking about offing myself for about half a year now. Nothing that brings joy. Nothing to live for. I have a job and I do like it but when I do not work I just smoke and drink my brain away. How do you find hapiness? Bad nights,1
I feel like if I had a gun in front of me it would be as easy as pulling a tooth and that just makes me feel like crying even more I cannot cope,1
"All I want is to be loved genuinely and unconditionally. Why do I have to get better for them to finally love me? How do I tell them that there is nothing wrong with me, this is just who I am and I am so sorry. I wish I was anything or anyone else. I am sorry I would be so much more lovable if I were dead",1
"Sorry, my English is pretty bad.. I just broke up with my boyfriend, bc a therapist said, i have Bpd. And I have lost everything and every goals and plans a had in my life.I have lost my job. I started learning to get my driving license, but i had to stop it. I have lost my 'friends' (mostly my bf's friends). I have lost him, and our cats, and also my goals and plans about learning to get better job, plans of marrying him, having kids, getting old together.We lived together in a house, so i had to move back to my grandparents. But they do not like I am here. They do not even care what is up with me.I really lost every of my hope to live. My 'friends' still telling me to move on, and stuff, but I just cannot live like this. I am not strong enough.Idk what should i do....Pls do not be mean with me. I want to kill myself bc I feel like I have lost everything",1
"From the outside I appear to be successful, I moved up in the corporate world quickly and at an early age. I also have my own business that does well. None of it means anything, it all just makes me feel more stuck in my current circumstances and life. Truth is I have been suicidal for over a year, I have letters written, plans in place but I just cannot commit to a date. I have no idea how to get out of this pointless life, there is no point to any of this. Work yourself to death so that you can retire then die. Suicide honestly seems to be a logical short cut when you weigh the years of work and sacrifice vs the ones your supposed to enjoy later in life. I came close a few months back but could not follow through. I am even more determined now though. Every day is just a chore, and I do not see the benefit on the other side of it all. I used to be healthy and really active, I cannot even get motivated to leave the house any more. My lifestyle has deteriorated into a substance abuse binge eating loop, I am pretty well finished with all this. I am successful but suicidal as hell",1
"They say suicide is selfish but if i decide why cannot i have the option to die peacefully after a certain age? is not it selfish for everyone to prefer me suffering everyday rather than being peacefully dead? Like if i decide to die, do not make me search for weird non guaranteed ways that can leave me seriously crippled, give me some amount of mandatory therapy and if a still want to after that, let me go.. I genuinely do not get why i need to live, i do not want help i want to die",1
"It really seems like my place in life is just to get hurt again and again. No matter what I try, suffering just finds me somehow. Every year for the past 10 years has been gradually worse and I am done with hope and positivity. I do not have any dreams or goals in my life.Sometimes I feel like an old person looking back at life, I do not believe I will achieve or experience anything new in my life. I am crippled by my mental illness and trauma and it feels bitter to realize that this is what my life has become. All that trying and achieving in school is worth nothing. I see no end in my suffering",1
"Apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense, I am feeling emotional and I am also a bit high...I have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks, have a history of attempts, and I think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until I 'do' something about them, i.e. try to off myself. And today I have been seriously considering doing it again, and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right (dog would be taken care of) and I had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. But, ambivalence.So...my dilemma is that if I am rational enough to think that I should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital ER, then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself, so then why am I even at the ER? But if I do not take myself there, it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should I or should not I' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong (which is not necessarily any time soon, based on recent history) or I am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. And I know I would just fail again. And I cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.I know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal, so I am not asking whether you think I should go to the hospital or not, but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? I usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since I went to ER and I am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. I do not want to feel like a moron telling them I am there because I do not want to kill myself, and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. I already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like I need them to connect me with that resource. But going it alone when I am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes. &amp;#x200B;TL;DR when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it, what did you do? How did it work out? Need thoughts on going to the ER or not",1
"This is not even really living at this pointI feel dead, when I am awake I just hurt so I do my best to be awake as little as possibleI hope one day Ill snap out of it, maybe its all a dreamBut sadly I do not think that is the caseEverything hurtsEverything fucking hurtsHow can you just do this to me?I hope you are happy.Meanwhile Ill keep fantasizing about ways to kill myself. I can barely keep my eyes open",1
"I do not want to leave behind all this clutter for someone else to have to clean up. it is the only thing that gives me pause when I am right on the brink of acting. I feel like I will either clean it up soon and have nothing stopping me, or just get so far down into this pit of darkness that I will not care anymore what happens after I am gone. I am only alive because my house is a mess.",1
"When I was a teenager and I first started experiencing being suicidal, the internet was a treasure trove of information- how to do this, where to get that and forums full of discussion. Now that I am an adult and I have my own time and money to finally come up with a plan to end my life- the internet is wiped clean. I can find none of this precious info I skimmed through so long ago I know things have changed a lot and the removal of all of these sites, posts and resources is for everyone is safety but I feel so frustrated, I am at a dead end. I do not know how to kill myself, the lethality of different methods or where to get anything I might need I kick myself for not taking past opportunities for easier ways to end my life, now I must find some very painful way as all other methods are not an option anymore. I hate that I cannot have genuine conversations on how to kill myself because its taboo I feel so, so lost. The internet used to tell me how to kill myself, now its blank",1
"I do not know if this subreddit is for me but i want to kill myself really badly. I have an eating disorder for almost half a decade now and its been all over the place. I have never been fully diagnosed. But half a year ago I was still sick but skinnier since then now i gained like 7kg which does not seem much and i can just work it off but i keep eating and i never was really suicidal but now I am actually considering, i know it seems strange but i feel this huge self hatred for the fact i cannot seem to control my intake anymore and that makes me so crazy and sad, because i know i can just lose it but i cannot seem to do it and it feels like i lost my mind. I feel like this is such a rude reason to attempt suicide because others seem to have it harder and i should be grateful, which i am. however, this is keeping me from living like i want to and be the person i desire to become. the problem is that i have to eat everyday but i cannot without feeling extrem guilt and hatred while eating more? i feel out of control and it makes me not take care of myself, because i do not want to shower due to my body. I habe a BMI of 20 which is normal but i feel morbidly obese. i know i might cone across as rude, i do not intend to be my eating disorder is making me suicidal",1
"26M. I have been thinking about suicide a lot lately, I am unsure of what went wrong in my life for me to even think this way but I do not feel like I am living, I already feel dead. I have never had a girlfriend and will probably never find love which is pretty much all anyone needs. I am a virgin. I am ugly. I am broke. I have never even been called attractive by a woman and its starting to weigh really heavily on me that Ill probably never find a love. I am unloveable and unwanted and if this is all life has to offer me I am better off dead so people do not have to put up with me being sad and a waste of space all the time. My heart really hurts and I am not having fun here. I have been thinking about suicide.",1
"Hello everyone lol!Currently sitting outside in the pouring rain in horrible pain hoping my pain relief kicks in (yay!)I honestly do not even know where to start anymore,like the title says my life just gets worse.I CONSTANTLY wonder what would have happened if I completed high school (yes I know I am working on my GED.)Anyways,I hate myself for not standing up for myself in school and not doing more with my life I am not ugly or obese so that is cool I guess.I definitely got worse mentally being that now I have chronic pain that at times is completely debilitating and other times I feel like a normal person which is a total mindfuck.I do not think I am stupid but I feel like I have nothing and am nothing but a body full of pain and misery.I am poor (I am glad I am not homeless of course.)I also share a room with my mom and do not even have a door to my bedroom (door broke off awhile ago and sharing a room sucks obviously lol.)I am also a virgin and cannot even fucking drive,have a permit or license I even confronted my dad today about it and said I have to be ""mature"" to drive yet my dad is a drug addict who does nothing and can do whatever he wants...I can keep going but I guess I will stop there..Anyway in the shit show called my life my dreams of cosmetology school are crushed being that I need to survive especially with this pain,and need 24/7 bathroom [access.It]( is not like I do not try either tried therapy (did not work at all typical 'it will get better' bullshit,and bringing up my chronic pain was a fucking joke too.)I do have hobbies I enjoy like drawing,painting,makeup,photography,poetry,and scrapbooking even though I feel like I suck at all of [that.It]( is such a joke now even the fucking chronic pain groups ignore me..also PLEASE do not tell me about therapy,dieting,meditation,or fucking celery juice bullshit..anyways I just hope I can find someone who can relate to me or possibly even make me feel less of a piece of shit.. My life just gets worse",1
"Every other day I feel like everyone is problems would be solved if I did not exist. I have been hearing voices for about six months now, and overtime the ones that use to be comforting when I was anxious have started telling me that everyone around me is lying to me about everything and my family is the only safe group of people. But even now they are telling me that my family would be safer if I was not around, my dad just quit his job and I have a distinct feeling that by me existing near them I am endangering them in some way. I am on medication as of the last couple days, but I have been going in this circle for months now. I feel okay for a few hours, slowly get worse, and by the next day I am one weird look from a stranger away from ending everything. I cannot do this anymore. I am exhausted. I do not even know why I bother to keep fighting the urge to leave. The feeling just comes back and it comes back a little worse everytime. Music has been helping. But now I can hear songs playing over eachother when I try to listen for too long. Everything is crumbling around me. I feel like I am melting into my surroundings. What do I do. cannot keep going in circles anymore",1
"Last year, I had the worst day of my life. March 15, 2020, I was across the country in my dream grad program. I was two days into a semester and my colleagues from all around the country and I were all enamored with each others brilliance. Id never felt so connected to another group of people. Two days and four hours into the semester, the sudden spike of covid-19 deaths caused my school to shut down and send us all home. For the past year, I have been separated from my flock, and last week we were reunited at last. This week has been everything I dreamed of for the past year, and my vaccinated friends and I are soaking in each others presence. Today, the bomb dropped again. Due to the increase in the delta variant, we are being sent home again. I had a ptsd flashback to the first time we were sent home and could not get ahold of myself. Every time I am here, it is far too brief, and it is even more painful to say goodbye this time. I was to graduate next week, and my classmates and I will likely never see each other again. Now I am suddenly going home to no job, because that too is once again suspended due to the delta variant. Because of the unvaccinated people in my country, I am forced to lose out on the only thing that gave my life any meaning anymore, and I am being forced to relive the most traumatic day of my life. Its hard to see the point anymore, and I am thinking of ending it all when I get home. I cannot do this again",1
"I was unable to cry for months. Idk what went wrong but I did not felt anything for months. Piled it up. I was not doing well, still does not feel good. I feel horrible but a little bit better. Tried my best to cry, forced it. Cried for like 10-15 mins. Eyes got pretty tired from it though. Physical weakness and the need to take a nap will help me to distract myself. I was planning a way to suicide and it is really hard to pick a method. Felt so stressed out when I saw it is not easy to end this pain. I cannot keep this anymore. That stress was there, used it. Brought some old memories back and cried it out. I guess some sleep will help to clear the rest. Whatever. it is just one day. Tomorrow will be worse. it is just one day. Crying helped",1
"Hi, I am 21 starting my junior year in college and I am currently on vacation. Well while at the pool by myself just enjoying the wonderful Florida sun, these rich kids I guess they were about my age, came up beside me and started calling me names like a stupid F**got, a fat ass, I do not remember the rest. Why are people so cruel to each other? I have worked for months to she would the weight which I was at, and I am genuinely proud of that. But when people say that I want to just jump off a bridge. I used to be obese, now I am just overweight and I am proud of that. I have lost nearly 40 pounds. Then they talk about how I was dressed and it was just a lot. I got up and came back to my condo where I am now just bawling my eyes out. Like I am not gay, but if it was is that an insult like I am so confused. I did not ask to be here so why do people consistently make it worse. I do not know those guys and what they go through, but are not it some shit that they can be born affluent, talk about people, get whatever they want in life and still live a happy life. I do not get it!!! Fuck this world, I do not want to be in it. I hate existing",1

"No feeling at all. I am completely numb. I have not felt anything but anger in a long time and while that is sustained me for quite awhile it to is starting to fade. One day soon there will be nothing left of me but an empty she will, devoid of any human emotion. When I heard about the children who were murdered at the residential schools I did not feel any emotion. My aunt died a few years ago and I felt nothing. People tell me they love me but I do not love them back. This is not a life. What I am doing right now is just existing at its most basic level and I am tired of it. Existing without being fully alive is a horrible experience and I cannot do it much longer. I know that my suicide will be devastating for my family and that is why I have hung around this long but I cannot continue existing just for other peoples sake. I do not feel anything anymore",1
"I will just introduce a bit.I am 21 years old.Currently on an internship away from home.I have struggled with depression on and off.

Same thing.I will be honest. If it were not for my lovely parents I would have done it. I feel lonely, I feel like there is avoid inside of me.I work in hospitality and with children.And I can smile temporarily when I can bring people a good time. But I just feel like my smile is not going to last forever.I feel like I am rotting away on the inside and I just do not know what to do with it.I have been procrastinating on my school assignments.

I am not sure, but when I look back at my life, all I see are fleeting moments of happiness followed by long periods of misery. My family might find this so, I am not going to mention them, but the time has come. After all my attempts to get help, to get on medication, to try coping strategies, I just cannot do it anymored. Today, for the millionth time, I called out of work because I cannot take the pressure. Today, for the millionth time I turned down a guy online bc all men see me for is a good time. My overall depression leads to my lack of motivation which is why I keep losing jobs. I am pathetic and worthless. I am both lonely and alone. I have decided to call 911 right before and do it while my roommate is away. I am hoping my last days will be good ones. I am Ready",1
Its wrong. Its a humiliation. do not make me keep living,1
"Today was the first time I really thought about suicide. I have often thought through my life about death and imagined dying and have said things like ""i wish I was not alive"" to myself multiple times a day and have so for many years. But this was sort of a coping mechanism I think to deal with stress. I have been pretty successful in life, and probably happy by a lot of people's standards. In general i have been pretty driven and interested. I was clinically depressed about 15 years ago, but I have not had a similar episode since.However, today I felt a really different feeling when my usual thought came for the day. I did not just think ""I do not want to be alive"", I thought ""maybe I will not be soon"". I thought of some familiar fantasy of dying, but this this time it was real life. I thought about how I could enact that fantasy. Then I wondered if that was really a realistic way to die. I do not want to die painfully. And I do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards. So I spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be, all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate, making dinner, talking to my spouse, putting the kids to bed.I just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing I did to cope with how stressed I was feeling to this other, ""oh I can do this"" feeling. It was so unexpected. It was just a normal day.I have never had these thoughts before, and I just wanted to write it down somewhere. I found this subreddit in the course of the day, and I have reddit so I thought it would be as good a place as any. July 28, 2021, maybe a new era in my life started today for reasons I cannot really understand.Thanks for listening Today was the first time i really thought about suicide",1
"Untill now I was the so called ""good guy"". Always trying to be pleasant around others, always trying to help, always saying ""thank you"" and ""you are welcome"" when needed etc. Recently I decided to adopt and raise a cat. But there is something very dark that came to the surface which I did not know that existed, and I have the very hard to resist temptation to hurt my cat, watch her squeal in fear as I am being a total piece of shit to her. First few weeks were great. I may have been rough to her sometimes during those weeks but it was nothing too serious. We were always sleeping together, playing together and we were practically inseparable. She was happy, and I was happy too.But once I decided to return to the house I grew up in, where some childhood trauma events have occurred, it was like a switch flipped, and I became a monster. I became very abusive towards my cat, and I have a very hard time stopping. Now I try to keep her outside my room and encourage her to hide because there is a monster inside me, which I cannot control.And because of that, I feel like I do not deserve anyone in my life. I was being a hypocrite all along, pulling of an act, and I deserve to be alone. Hell, I feel so guilty that I want to outright die, because I cannot live with the guilt and shame because of this.I know there will be people who will hate me for what I said. And I am really scared because of what I am about to post. But then again, I have never done the right choice anyway.I deserve the hate. I am lost",1
"I never thought it is possible, but I have a case of mental illness, that is practicaly incurable. it is based on ""only"" severe emotional neglect through childhood (and adulthood) but when it is mixed up with too much responsibility from early age, it becomes incurable.I will explain. Normally in therapy patients are taught to find their inner child and nurture it the way patients have not been nurtured. This gives the restless inner child fixing experiences and after few years of inner child work, mental health gets better. But if you are neglected AND you had to take care of yourself, taking care of your inner child is just playing the trauma again, so it is not healing. It is only retraumatizing.And this mixture means constant panic-like feelings, like what a baby would feel when left on the side of the road. Panic, fear, chaos, eventually deathwish. These feelings might be on the surface or hide in dark, but they are never absent. Therefore I do not sleep. I do not enjoy. I do not connect. I do not love. There is no hope of feeling nurtured or satisfied unless someone else does the parentification. And since I am not adoptable minor, that means never. So do you know any cults with charismatic father-figures? Can be a suicide cult. Incurable mental pain",1

"NSFWI have been depressed since a child. I watched my grandfather die at age 4 of a heart attack in front of me, I was sexually assaulted by my neighbors and age 7 my bio dad passed away. When I was 12 one of my friends committed suicide by hanging himself in his home. I lost my paternal grandma age 18, my maternal grandma age 20 and step grandma age 21 all whom I was extremely close with. I lost my uncle a few weeks before Christmas due to a heart attack just after losing my paternal grandmother right before Thanksgiving.In 2015 my cousin was murdered (shot in the back of the head) in 2018 my paternal grandfather to a heart attack and we had to pull the plug, he died on my fathers birthday 6 February which is 6 days before my birthday. Also, in June 2018 I lost my younger brother due to a devastating car accident that left his body mangled and we found this out the day after it happened, right after my other grandfathers funeral. My brother did not have his ID on him so they could not identify him immediately.2020 I lost my aunt due to a heart attack two days after Thanksgiving. 14 January 21 I lost my mother after her battled with Covid-19. Due to having small children, one with severe respiratory issues and the pandemic I had not seen my mother. The last time I saw her alive was in early December at my aunts funeral. That was the last time I hugged her and held her hand.Forward to March and I lost another aunt, she lost her battle with leukemia.there is more death and many other reasons but my main trigger has been death/loss. I have cried because I am tired of living and want to end my life. I get angry that I have kids because I am afraid of what my loss will do to them and my wife. Especially, after already losing a brother and recently losing two aunts and our mother, I am afraid of what would happen to my brothers if I kill myself.But, the desire is increasing everyday. I am miserable, in a miserable marriage with a wife that does not get me and cares solely that her needs (physical touch) are not being met.I am just ready to leave life behind! Death cannot come soon enough",1

But this is the second time in my life where I feel like I have absolutely no options left. I tried so many ways to be happy and to survive in the past year and they all failed spectacularly or simply evaporated. The crazy thing is that it is not even my fault, I did everything I could. Its the pandemic, it is the economy, it is our slow-ass indecisive bureaucracies, it is everyone being sad at the exact same time.I am talking to a military recruiter soon because I feel like it is my only option left in order to have any level of economic security. But everything else failed, so what is keeping this from not working out too? I have already come really close to killing myself in the past month and a half. I do not want to feel trapped, I do not want to feel like I do not have any options just to simply live. When you feel trapped, you are always one step away. I do not want to be there.

"So this is my first time posting on Reddit, apologies if I mess up. To make a long story short, I failed my first year of college. My parents are okay people. they have done some bad stuff to me in the past, but I know they love me so I try to not put it against them. So my dad took out a loan to help me pay for college. Thing is, after COVID restrictions, my mental health went down, way down. I was hardly showing up to my online classes, hardly doing assignments. I failed most of my classes both semesters. I am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides, but I did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this. They are going to pay off the loan today, and its killing me inside. I do not know if they will find out I failed this year or not, but either way I feel that I am such a horrible child, even if I cannot help my mental illness I could have reached out. I do not even want to go to college anymore. I do not want my parents to dump so much money on my stupid suicidal ass, I want to die so they do not have to pay off my loans. I cannot go on, I feel like a walking failure for not just doing my work. Why did not I do it? what is wrong with me? I hate myself so much, why cannot I just be a good child to my parents? I cannot do anything right so I feel like the only way to repent is to die any advice is appreciated I am such a horrible child",1

Advice for what to say to my suicidal partner?",1
32 years of fight and I have not got another round in me. I give up . I throw In the towel.. I thought having my son 7 years ago would give me enough purpose but that bad seed in my brain just keeps growing. What was the point of any of this? Game over,1

"Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker. Most of my english comes from memes and series. I am 25 years old male, big loser with no education and living in a shit hole. I have been depressed since I have been concious, and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore. My father was not present when I was a kid, and because my mom had to take care of me alone, she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid. The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot, and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant, I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts. I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis. It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing, and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day. After that, I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me (this was when I was 9 yo). At my 11 years of age, I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me. The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then. All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner, and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that. I deserted my undergrad (Mechatronics) because I was scared of failing again in life, and running always seemed easier and safer (I deeply regret this now that I am older, but it is too late to go back). Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty, with no education, no good jobs prospects, nothing. I was very close to end my life a few days ago, but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything, and she convinced me to not do it. I have never tried suicide before, but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good. My current relationship is long distance. she is in another country, with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident. Because of my lack of education and preparation, it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is. We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in, and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then, and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again (yea, I know that this was a very bad decision). I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there. My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not? This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship, but now that I am compromised with someone, and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing. It really sounds ridiculous. She says that she is deeply in love with me, and would do anything to be together. I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me. I also deeply love her, and I do not think I could forgive myself ever. I want to end my life. I do not think I can fix my situation, and even so, the temptation of killing myself will ever go away. I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life, and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her. I hope that my mother, girlfriend and friends could forgive me, but maybe that is asking for too much. I definitely do not deserve any of that. Thank you for reading my story. Am at my wits' end. Thinking about death feels like peace.",1
"I am 19 and I feel like I have wasted the best years of my life. When I was younger I was extremely shy and scared of everything. I was scared of talking to people at my school, and talking to girls. Even though I was not ugly or something. When I went to highschool I did not really enjoy going to partys with people I did not know so I partied with my closest friends. Now when I have finished highschool I know that I wasted that time. I wish I was more outgoing, not so shy and did not spend so much time at home. I know that there is a lot of younger people here. So I want you to stop worrying and enjoy this time. Ask her/him out, you have got nothing to lose. you will get rejected? So what? Stop dreaming about things that can happen and actually do something to make them happen. I wish I asked Eve out, I did not do it but I knew that she was into me. Maybe I was wrong? I would get rejected? I do not care. Start living and maybe one day you will not feel like me.

"I am SO FUCKING TIRED OF LIVING I JUST want to BE 21 SO I CAN FUCKING BLOW MY BRAINS OUT I just got kicked out of my own room and I cut myself again after months of being self-harm free. I have lost everything and nothing gives me pleasure anymore. My mom has told me to kill myself and our relationship is extremely toxic. My dads been dead for years and my dog is the only one that gives me some form of love. But love is bullshit and not real because it always hurts no matter from who. It all keeps tumbling down and I just keep letting me down.I seriously do not know what I am going to do when I go back to college with my roommates, especially because my classes are still online (I W A N T D E A T H) I guess just act happy as usual right? Until I can finally gain the sweet peace i fucking deserve and no longer have to hear these terrible thoughts inside my head. Earth drives everyone crazy, its just a matter of how much you hide your craziness from others because you want to be perceived a certain way. Fuck this world and everyone in it. I quit",1
I felt like an idiot so I just hung up lol The hotline put me on hold for 20 minutes,1
"I have lost everything everything and everyone around me. The one person that was keeping me alive left me and stopped talking to me. I have been played with and people only used me. Look my mom mental abuses me and talks down on me. Always arguments between us, we just have a horrible relationship. I am only 14 and I cannot do anything to help myself. I just wish I could be a kid again so I do not have to feel this pain. My dad left and he was my everything and I do not have him anymore. I have stayed up all night with a hand full of pills wondering what I live for anymore. I cannot look at the good things in life anymore. I am just so numb to the pain at this point. My mom does not care about me and how I feel. It does not help my cousin I am close with is severely suicidal and almost went to a mental hospital. All I think about is dying. I just wish I did not wake up in the mornings. I just miss life being easy and not having to worry about anything. My family has been homeless for half of my life just living with people. I stay in my room all day there is nothing to do when you have zero mental energy to even get out of bed or even eat. Then one of my closest friends I was living with tried killing me and my mom. The police were involved and did actually nothing about it, did not even charge him. He tried calling me after saying sorry, he is a sick person. I just want to scream so loud. I am just kind of done with living",1
"I do not know how people can keep full time jobs. I have always had to job hop because I get incredibly overwhelmed and suicidal when I have to work for so long. You have no free time to do anything that you enjoy when working because your off days you have to play catch up on chores you missed during the week. You do not have the time to go see your loved ones and friends. You become so stressed that you lie in bed at night and get absolutely no sleep. You have no time to cook a healthy meal because you come home at night and you are so exhausted from the day. My anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and suicidal tendencies just start spiraling and I feel like I am drowning. I am expected to keep working because everything in life is so expensive. Why is life so expensive? I would love to stay home and tend to my home/pets but I cannot afford to not work. I feel so stuck. I feel like I would much rather commit suicide than continue to suffer this way... I would rather die than work for the rest of my life",1
A fucking monster I am evil,1
"I have been suicidal for it feels like no reason but there is a reason i do not want to live anymore because of the type of household i live in its toxic and i hate it my parents are split so i only have a mom and step dad i have not seen my biological father in 8 years. anyways my household is toxic af.. when my sisters eating dinner she has to ask to use the bathroom she is 7.. she already talks to me about how she hates herself and she calls herself stupid or dumb she is not my actual sister she is my half sister. I am a teen and i still have to put my phone up at 8pm everyday i do not want to to sound addicted to my phone but it is the only way I am able to cope since my parents hardly ever let me go outside and at night is usually when i start feeling down or suicidal so i have no one to talk to. i have to ""earn"" my privacy i have to keep my door open unless it is night or I am changing so i do not get any privacy at all they only approve of one friend and I have known her since i was 3. They get mad at the smallest things and there things they say to me hurt and make me overthink everything. my friends and boyfriend love me endlessly and my boyfriend tells me i can talk to him about anything but i cannot talk to him about this or he would end up in tears he is the only reason why I am still here but i still feel like ending everything because i feel a burden to the world. I do not know if I am overreacting or not but i just want advice . idk anymore just give advice or help",1

I am quite tired of fighting, if it is me or it is not me the effect is the same, if I was bad no one will miss me, and everyone will be happy that I am dead, and if someone loved me?

"*^(\*(this got deleted from the self-harm section so I am reposting here)\*)*self-harm has been a struggle for me for a while now.the other night i had a very bad episode (intense panic, I have been struggling with depression and severe anxiety for a while now). so i grabbed my blade, went to the bathroom, and wanted to end it all. i went very very deep on my arms (vertically). my dad saw my arms and grabbed the blade away from me, my mom tried to help &amp; i was taken to the hospital where i got stitches.these past 2 days, a number of people in my life have found out about the incident 2 nights ago. let me tell you, not one of them has reached out to ask if i was okay or tell me they were glad i was still here. they are just so ..... nonchalant about it.its basically confirming the fears I have had for years now -- that, if i actually went through with my urges &amp; committed suicide, no one would care. i mean their behavior is pretty much proving it. my own siblings and parents have not said a word about it. just ""stay safe vanessa"". that is it.i fucking wish it worked.

I am facing academic exclusion because I have failed so many classes and I feel like I am going nowhere, fast. I am poor so I have no choice but to make it and that is a lot of pressure.

"I give up, I have been battling suicide and suicidal thoughts since I was ten.I used to have something that made me keep on living, my dogs, my mom, my friends; this is not the case anymore.I know this is selfish but I really do not have the mental strength anymore, I cannot find the strength in anybody, I feel like my life is a subtle form of agony (I will never compare my life to what some people go through, and I know I definitely do not have it worse, but I cannot explain it, its kind of like as if it was a continuous loop, or as if you were just chained and could not get out), I just want to be free, I have waited years for finding the light at end of the tunnel after I said no almost last minute at my first/only suicidal attempt, but I did not, I just experienced more bullying, more psychological abuse, more trauma, more hatred for myself (eating disorders and body dysmorphia), although I have taken some big steps on the last thing, and although I am starting to see myself as beautiful I still cannot talk or act normally when I see someone (whatever they are a he, a she, or a them) that its beautiful because I feel inferior to them, I am afraid of getting insulted in the streets because I am ugly, I think Ill never be loved (as in loved by a boyfriend), heck sometimes I even question my gender (I am 99% sure its not actual gender dysphoria but rather envy or just the feeling of being someone different) at times I do not feel comfortable or part of my friends group, I wish I could tell them how I feel but I cannot because I hate being vulnerable.I wish I could...you know, but I literally have NOTHING to do it (or at least to not have a painful end).Probably still going to prepare in case it happens, I am going to give my password to one of my friends so that they can continue to post content on my insta (I have not posted since February my followers deserve some damn content) I wish I could do it but I do not have anything",1
"My grandmother told me you are not the granddaughter I know when I opened up about my abuse and trauma from my parents when I got into an argument with them.

I am glad to have some supportive friends but recently I have been pretty burned out from the constant abusive words I am faced with everyday. I have not really talked to anyone since I just have no energy at all. Maybe I should take my grandmas advice and never EVER open up about my abuse and trauma. Hell, maybe I should stop doing to my therapist all together since Ill never be able to beat my depression. My whole life just continues to spiral down. Its gotten to the point where I have been contemplating suicide again since I have previously failed years ago.

I feel like such a freak for the smallest of things and I do not know how to let it out anymore....I feel like I keep making the same mistakes over and over again and yet I have no one to let vent to or let out all this frustration and to truly tell how much of a worthless piece of shit I feel likeGod I am so lonely, lonely and tired and yet I cannot even get a God damns night rest anymore.

But, I still have a lot of resistance to overcome. I want to be able to do the deed in a calm, detached manner.

But there is that pesky self-preservation instinct to overcome yet. Mentally preparing myself for the end",1
"I really do not want to because its honestly very depressing for me to think that at the young age of 23, I am already considering throwing away my one and only life. I wish I believed in some form of reincarnation but I honestly do not. I think that if it were possible to somehow trade my life away for another and start all over again, I would do it without hesitation. But nobody is capable of figuring out what truly lies beyond death and still be around to tell about it. Is it just an empty void or is it eternal torture what is waiting for me? I am scared to find out. I honestly do not think Ill miss anyone or anything that exists in this world. I am having trouble finding new interests to keep me entertained and I am losing the very few that I do. I love my parents, I would be devastated when the time comes when they are no longer around. I honestly do not think I could say the same about any of my siblings, any secondary family members, or anyone else in general. I have become estranged with just about everyone. Most of them just see me as a lazy bum who does not care to improve himself, and maybe they are right. But I am also not right in the head, so can you really blame me for the way that I feel? I feel alone.I have ideas on how i could get better but I am just too lazy to do anything about it. I think most of this laziness comes from how mentally strenuous some of my ideas are and whether or not it will even be worth it in the end. Id hate to give myself a bigger headache than what I already have right now, all for nothing.At this point, I find myself romanticizing the act of suicide more and more. To finally take charge of your own life and do the inevitable. I kind of hope that my life will get progressively worse just so that making the decision to commit suicide will be a lot easier. Or at least motivate me enough to finally take action into improving myself out of desperation. I am at the beginning stages of considering suicide and its making me very uncomfortable.",1
Please not tonight. Yes my will is weak I am losing my shit while writing this. Please save me I am scared One more reason to continue,1
"I do not know where else to turn to. It feels like my brain hates me. I should be happy, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and clothes on my back, more than a lot of other people have. I should be able to smile, but it drains more energy out of me than I can possibly describe. The voices in my head tell me I am not good enough, I will never be good enough. Pathetic. Useless. Worthless. Stupid. waste of space, time, energy, and matter. the world would be better without me, besides what is a small screw in the grand scheme of things, the world will still spin, my family will move on. Maybe without me dragging them down, they can finally be happy. I look in the mirror and I harbor nothing but disgust and resentment for that \*thing\* looking back at me. and then it speaks to me, Pathetic. Useless. I learned at a young age, people will pretend to care about you if they can see your scars, so I cut my legs, they cannot see those, no one will ever see those. they pretend to care, and then talk behind your back, ""oh look, cutting again, how PATHETIC"" ""grow up"" ""be a man"" I have told my family about the monsters, they say its just a phase, 'its not a fucking phase I just want to feel ok, ok motherfucker now you have got my attention, I need to change a couple things', but what to change, I eat right, I exercise, literally only drink water. My dog is the only thing in this world keeping me here. I made the decision to kill myself June 23rd 2020, at 5:21 am, I tied a noose and hung it in my closet, wrote a note that no one would ever care about and stepped into my closet for what I thought was the last time, then my dog barked, and she never does that. I cannot do that to her, So I will live for her. but how Pathetic, staying alive for a dog. an animal that would forget about me in a month. I have family that would forget about me in a month, ""friends"" that do not even care now. I bring up my past to family, my parent told me its ""impossible for a man to get raped"" well, guess I am the impossible, happened twice in my life, once at 13 and again at 15, so I secluded myself away from women and now I have a hard time opening up to them when trying to get a relationship, and they do not understand that, not exactly something to bring up on a first date, and heh, never get second ones. How Pathetic, typing to a bunch of strangers who do not care. why should they. I have tried getting help, but the meds make me feel worse, all of them, the therapists push their agendas, no one is against you, they are only for themselves, but if I am not for myself, then no one is. Worthless. I have even done things that I thought id never do, I have prayed, and prayed, looking, asking for help, for the strength to get rid of my demons, my monsters, to no avail. The monster just laughs at me, Useless. I used to be smart, used to have a lot of practical knowledge, now its all superficial, Stupid. Nothing I do in this life will make any difference, the words I say will bring no impact to anyone else. all I want is for just one (1) person to read this, I suppose. but that is a lot to ask. why would they waste their time, their energy, their precious internet activity on someone so,,, Pathetic. I want to reach out, but I am just a waste of space, time, energy and matter, I do not matter. I never will, when I die, the history books will never say my name, they will never look at me, just bones in the ground turning to dust, at least ill be useful to the fungus, probably not even the right place to post this, there are so many more people in more need than I am, I made a promise, and I intend to keep it, I will not die until I give my dog the best life, its what she deserves. does not mean I do not spend every waking moment wishing, thinking, planning my death, one day just disappear, never to be seen again. I would go to Canada, in the northern forests, find a spot in the summer, I have already picked my day, June 23rd. what a good day to die, the method, I am not so sure, guns are messy, pills are unreliable, rope does the trick. If anyone has read this, I thank you, I am sorry you have decided to waste your time reading the words of some\*thing\* like me, but I thank you nonetheless. I have had this typed out for 3 days, just hovering over the post button, not wanting to burden others with my stupid problems. if this gets sent at all, id be surprised.

"But would you want to face the possibility of finding yourself in a world like this one and go through hell again? Face your demons here friends. To live is to suffer, but do not worry, death never misses. When its your time, its your time. It might seem long, but its not, millions of years have passed and trillions of plants, animals, and humans have already died. Hell, 20 years ago for me seemed like yesterday. Do whatever feels right for you, seriously, fuck what society or anyone else thinks. Do whatever you want, except taking the life out of yourself. Death itself will take care of that for you, it always does, with 101% accuracy. You might think you are already dead inside, but are not well all? Its either that or were numb from pleasure. Let yourself be a goddamn mess, because damn, madness is beautiful and we all know we need a little(a lot) more crazy in this world. You do not want to be here in this hell",1

"In less than a month I will kill myself, unfortunately I feel only sadness or pain, I am just a loser and no matter how many years I live, this fact will not change, so I decided that it would be easier to finish it all, all I hope is that I feel nothing, whether during My attempt to commit suicide or after my death, I wish I had not been born or lived some happy moments in my life, every day is worse than the previous one and unfortunately I am becoming a worse person day by day, so I may rest a bit after my death, thank you and I wish everyone a happy life I hate myself",1

"I so desperately want this to be over. I despise every last thing about myself. I am 30, and I have never experienced any kind romantic or sexual intimacy, because I am an ugly gay man and completely inept when it comes to dating (I have no experience). I have been so poor that I cannot feed myself. My career as a professional musician has gone down the tubes because of the pandemic, and I am stuck with a new job that gives me intense anxiety and amplifies my self-hatred. Nobody in my life has any idea it has gotten this bad, and I do not want to reach out to friends or family, because I am sick of the well-intentioned responses that make me feel to blame, or worse about myself.While I do blame myself for quite a lot, I do not blame myself for wanting to die. This world really fucking sucks. I have no hope for society in general - late-stage capitalism and climate change are the terminal cancer of humanity, and I am sure that it is people like me that are going to suffer the worst deaths.I cannot say I have not tried to get better. I have had aloof unsympathetic therapists over the years who have prescribed me medicine I end up not being able to afford. But I still tried. Yesterday, I called down a list 20 therapists covered by my insurance the other day to see if they were accepting new patients and not one of them called me back. I guess I just really do not believe anyone is really equipped, capable, or willing to help me out of this.The obstacles keeping me from killing myself are insurmountable, like knowing the effect it would have on my family, my cat, and the lack of a riskless/painless method. So for now, I guess I am just stuck in this unbearable existence. Being able to kill myself is just as ludicrous of a goal as me finding any level of real or sustainable happiness. I do not know what to do with that other than writhe in agony until my natural time comes. Hell is real, and I am here. the definition of hell",1
"I cried for the first time in years, the summer class i depended on told me i was not eligible and i could not follow the course anymore after two weeks of learning i enjoyed. My school functions on a modular system which is extremely flawed towards students with undiagnosed ADHD and little autonomy. I love learning but my school does not have teachers, we have modules, 60-130 pages of self-learning. This system where students advance at their own pace is a nightmare for people with un medicated ADHD like me. In part to why i loved my summer class so much was because the teacher would talk to you and guide you through the subject. I wish i had changed schools earlier in my highschool career, its too late for all that. Being a maximum one year behind was my goal and i would have reached it if i had finished 8th grade science when i was 14. In 9th grade they removed my science and social studies subjects to focus on the more ""important"" ones, same for 10th grade. Why would they do this if you need them to graduate? I have planned suicide this whole year, delaying it with the thought that if i finish this summer class i will only have to do two years in one. My second option now gone, I have never been closer to sneaking out and jumping off an abandoned parking lot nearby. I have hit a dead end. I will not graduate and I will not go to college. i will be 16 doing 8th grade science. putting me 3 years behind.",1
I had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself. I must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night. Thankfully I did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time. My wife and I drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends. Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good. I hate myself so much for what I have become and yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself. Instead just wishing it changes on its own. Even killing myself I often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something. How awful is that? I am so lazy and lately I cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore. We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent. At the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so I do not feel as bad. I keep wishing I was a better person and yet never taking any action. I am the only one that can make a change. It does not just happen but I am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything. Someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop. I am just looking to get this off of my chest - please disregard,1
"My dream is to live on a farm. Maybe not a whole farm, but I want a cute little cottage big enough for two cats, a dog or two, some chickens, and a garden. To live in a small town, preferably where family values are still alive. Id love to have someone to love and cherish, and wed have a kid or two one day. My husband would be really nice to me and not make fun of me or compare me to other girls and make me feel like a failure for being born. I want to be known as that cute, polite, mysterious farm girl instead of a depressed, anxious orphan. To finally have someone I can tell my story to and they would hug me and comfort me and tell me its going to be okay, instead of just saying that is rough. Id love to have a small job on the side and spend the rest at home taking care of the household. I do not hold much value to myself anymore, I only continue to live for other peoples sake anyway. that is my dream. Maybe one day Ill get to it. I am not so hopeful though. The life i dream of",1

TRIGGER WARNING ..........I was violently raped in 2015 and I still have flashbacks. This is one factor in my decision to commit suicide. I am in therapy but I just do not think I can get over it and I think this is why I cannot make friends because it was basically date rape. And the fact that it was date rape fucks me up too. It feels like it was less of a rape because the judge claims that because I willingly went to the guys house (after meeting him twice at restaurants) that it was not considered rape. I am just feeling especially bad today. :( Kill myself because of being raped?,1

For 7 years I have been suffering from nightmares that are recurring every single day, I have engaged on a relationship when I was 19 and i got sexually harassed and forced into sex. I then realized that I liked guys more and been in a relationship for 5 month with a guy I met online and left me after me having a couple of breakdown... All of my projects failed and I now have no money to help my family and I have broke every single friendship that I had so far.The funny thing? This is only a sumI've tried, i really did with my psychiatrist but every single event in my horrible life ended up being a disaster, i have no hope for the future other than dying in my sleepI... do not know what to do anymore...

Hey guys I am new here so I really do not know what I should talk about. I am 19 years old and I am suicidal. Every night I try to kill myself but end up failing badly that which frustrates me. Yesterday was the day that it finally dawned upon me that I wanted to end it all. I have never had anyone to get me through this except for myself and my bipolar disorder. Not even my family try or reach out to me so I am hoping to get good advice here on Reddit. Well mainly because it is my Dad causing these suicidal tendencies. I cannot even do the things I love anymore. I cannot even enjoy one of my games properly because of these thoughts of feeling utterly useless. I hope this reaches out the people that can help me. Because I truly am suffering. 19 years Old Suicidal,1

"I plan to die around the end of November, I know what date I am going to do it and I have some ideas on how I am going to die. I chose November because my big important essay is due, and I do not want to waste my effort from writing the first and second drafts. Another reason is because I was suppose to die on the same day a few years ago but I had to go somewhere.I have been feeling like shit for years, especially this summer. My old therapist ( last meeting was 3 years ago, 9th grade, first suicide attempt ) gave me meds that did not even work ( 50mg and only 8 tablets, and its fucking expensive ) and his last advice was to ""have fun"". Yeah thanks a lot. I have been coping in a really bad way, but I do not know if I am ready to give it up.School-wise I am doing fine, but my parents are hell-bent on making me go to college in my home country ( because the school gave me the wrong term 3 results ) and I do not want to go there because of its conservative laws and I have views that can get me killed or shunned, a shit ton of victim-blaming and overall I just want to go far away from my parents because they treat me like I am 5. My mom insists that I stay at home and go to online-school when I am in college, and it made everything worse. I said to myself ""I would rather kill myself than be with them"" I do not know what major I want to be in, I just want to move out. I do not know why, but this subreddit makes me feel safe for telling all of this. I do not know where to get better advice. I lost my reason to live, I do not know what to do.I will do an update if I am alive by then. I want to end it all",1
"Just do it Nobody will care Nobody does care I do not matter Not good enough Just stop I do not deserve loveThese thoughts go through my mind constantly, every day. I hear them nonstop. Always hearing that I am no good and I am not good enough. Its true. I do not have any value in this world. Someone once commented something along the lines of everyone deserves love and kindness, to which I have a question. If everyone deserves love and kindness, then why have not I gotten any? If everyone in this world deserves it, then why am I alone right now, with no one? Unlike everyone, I do not deserve love and kindness. Instead, I should be hurt and used and insulted and criticized. that is what I have been my whole life. Abandoned. Left behind. Forgotten. Blocked. that is what I know best. Thoughts",1

I wish I could come on here and say something useful.",1
"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain",1

"I was born with meth in my system,my mom was going to abort me but my step-dad decided to intervene.My biological dad that I have never met was a depressive loser with a little dick and I inherited everything from him but his tallness.I grew up homeless essentially,we got to stay at my great grandmas house alot,but the majority of my childhood was spent in my step dads Chevy k5 blazer.Throughout my life I always moved,whenever I would make friends and gain a connection,we would leave,it left me numb and unable to form relationships, with the abject poverty and constant drinking,partying,domestic violence every night, and a mom that never hid anything from me, I had to grow up quickly. By 10 years old I had already told myself that I was ready to die, not that I wanted to,but I was ready.This made me really unrelatable to my peers,I acted like a little old man and never got to experience a normal childhood.By my high-school years everybody thought I was a crackhead because I was always nervous,my clothes were dirty,and I never had good shoes, this led to me accepting that I was a loner,but I am full of social desire.All this made me really cold and unfeeling on the outside,I am really bad at expressing my emotions and anytime someone is fighting or in an argument I revert to the same frozen state of my childhood.Fast forward to now,I am 20 years old and I am the only source of income in my family,my step-dad has been in prison for 3 years on a 15 year bid. My mom has alot of health problems but even so she refuses to work or get disability,her constant drinking worries me.my 16 year old sister lost her mentor when her dad went away,these last few years she has been following my mom's mold,smoking cigarettes,dropping out of school,doing nothing.I work 48 hours a week and when I come home I am 100% occupied by serving others, I have no future, no personality, no ambition, I do not even have my license yet,I am just spinning in circles going through a deep cycle of depression and coping mechanisms.I am fat and short,have an odd shaped body and just generally ugly, I have no redeeming qualities physically,I cannot stand to look at myself in the mirror,or work up the courage to find a GF and be loved,but I get awkward around girls I like and make things weird.I have no purpose.No place on this earth I bought really sharp knives on Amazon, but I do not want to be in pain and reflect on my life as I lie bleeding out,I am waiting to get a gun so I can just do a quick shot to the head and get I over with,no more bad thoughts,no more missing the countless friends I have left behind in the 30+ schools I went to as a kid,no more pain, no more me.

"I have let fear and insecurity lead my entire 20s. here is is what happens after 10 years.I did not think about what I wanted to do because thinking about myself and the future was terrifying. I could have pushed myself trough that discomfort but did not. I ended up doing two majors I cannot get a job with. Or even like to do. I told myself I would, but deep inside it was not for me. I have adhd and generalized anxiety disorder.I did not make many friends because of my crippling self hatred and insecurity. I preferred to be alone.Yeah I hushed that fear by thinking everything would come to me by itself. I was raised a very lucky kid. I think that is why I thought it would all be ok, like everything up until like 25.We had a beautiful house in a very nice neighborhood, a second house, could practice anything we wanted, never had to worry etc. I would say my parents are kind of elitist. I had all the opportunities in the world.Now I stand on my own legs and can barely pay for anything. Next to that I have lost the things you lose at 29. The excitement, parties, friends, something to look forward to. Part of my looks I literally have nothing that gives me joy.I am so lonely. I am so regretful. The dead end.",1
"This is just a rant. While my highs are not high, my lows and very, very low. And its creeping back in. I am unable to comprehend how random and chaotic my mind is right now. And the only way out is the easy one. How can I be the bad guy, how can she hate me more that her abuser and her molester?What burns me the most is that hes gotten away with it, now hes happy with a new born. I am sure she is forgiven him, but I know she will never stop hating me, because my existence is a reminder of the guilt and betrayal she inflicted on me. Every time she thinks about me, she cannot accept the fact that what she did was wrong. But people will defend her. She was manipulated and abused I know her well, well enough to know that even now when she touches her self she thinks about him, the memories they had, how good it felt, the rush and excitement. And deep down she does not regret it. I cannot stand the fact that in her story, the one who loved her. I am the bad guy. Its creeping back again, and the only answer is me leaving this crazy world",1
"there is a million different reasons why. I am autistic, I was bullied throughout my school years and emotionally abused by my parents at home.

"I am asexual (which means I have no sex drive and feel no sexual attraction) and I will never have a romantic relationships because of it. I have schizophrenia, dissociation, depression. I have had a horribly traumatic brain infection which gave me PTSD, I had a benzodiazepine overdose which probably gave me a brain injury (do not know if it did, I have been postponing the MRI). I have an abusive father who used to beat me. I was bullied and excluded in both primary school and high school. I have 1 true friend. Yet my relative said about me that I am the most kind person she is ever met. I do not deserve this crap. There are probably some more shitty things I forgot to list because, well, brain injury... Wow my life sucks",1
"I am 18. I cannot even bear a thought to even live anymore. Everything has been taken away from me. When I was small I was sexually abused by my cousins multiple times. I have told my parents but they shut me by saying that I am lying. I am still confused about how a 4-year-old child will lie. I was abused till the age of 10. Till now i stutter to talk to older men. Then I work way up in my studies. Even got declared as a good student in my district at the age of 11, but I manage to get only 6A 1B in my UPSR. (UPSR is a Malaysian-based examination for students at the age of 12). I did not lose hope and studied hard. In class teachers used to praise me being a smart student but only to get lower marks in exams. I do not know what is wrong with me and my examinations. Then PT3 happen and I got 6A 4B. I got into science streams. 2019 was the worst year for me would be an understatement. I was accused of cheating, stealing stuff by a teacher. I was removed as the head prefect of my school and president of the red crescent society of my school. I was falling into depression. I started to skip classes. Thoughts of hurting myself have always been in my mind. At the end of 2019, all the accusations thrown at me were proven wrong but people still treated me like I am some kind of a bad person. I just want everything to end but my friends always stop me. So in my last year of high school, I studied hard, despite the pandemic. I worked my ass off. My friends were worried about me. I just wanted to get out of my house and pursue my dream job. I wanted to become a doctor. In The SPM examination, I got 7A 3B, and 2C. ( The Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia, or the Malaysian Certificate of Education, is a national examination taken by all fifth-form secondary school students in Malaysia. ) I was exictied and thrilled, except for my parents who were angry that i got 3B and 2C. Well i applied for Matriculation in my country. Unfortunately, I did not get in bcuz my country has this quota system where only 90 % of Bumiputera ( Bumiputra is a Malaysian term to describe the Malay race and other indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia, and used particularly in Malaysia. ) while only 10% of Non-Bumi are allowed despite being a citizen of malaysia. I was very disapointed. I wanted to pursue A levels but my family denied. So i went for the second best option STPM, ( STPM is a pre-university examination in Malaysia. ). I got in science stream and i was happy. I later found out my parents have changed my stream to arts as they want me to become a lawyer. I wanted to become a doctor. When i ask the school administrators for advice they told me i cannot do anything. Nothing can be changed. I feel numb. I feel the world has stopped. I feel nothing is meaningful anymore. I feel my life has ended. I wanted to end all of this paain. I cannot bare anymore. I do not want my friends to feel guilty that its their fault. i just want to dissapear. I cannot handdle this pain and toture. i just want to pursue my dream but there is no other way. I feel i am going to hurt myself. I do not know what to do. I feel the world has stopped and I just want to dissapear",1
"I need to be dead, but I cannot bring myself to commit suicide. But I made a plan, a week ago, and at first I wanted to wait untill my sister leaves for uni, but I do not think Ill be able to make it for this long. I honestly never thought it would come to this, I said I wanted to be dead, I prayed to die countless of times, but always thought I am too much of a wuss to actually kill myself I am not so sure anymore. I cannot keep up a job. I started working now after almost a year of sitting at home, but I am already breaking down and had panic attack before and at work. I am living with my father even though I will be 21 soon. I do not even know what to say and how to explain myself to others anymore. I have no future, no plans, no nothing. All my energy goes into trying to survive, into getting through the day, into not killing myself. I cannot deal with people. I have severe social anxiety. No one understands me, and I cannot do therapy because I just go mute everytime. I am terrified of going to the doctors. I am not even registered with a GP. (I am not from the UK) I have taken Fluoxetine, Lamotrigine (when I was still in school, likely as a misuderstandimg because I would not say anything, and I would miss my appointments because my mother would not take me there) and Sertraline (last year, privately, through online appointments because I am incapable of going to a real doctors office) and none od them worked. They made me feel nauseous and gave me headaches. I also went through an episode of unexplained joint and bone pains, that made me lay on bed and cry from the pain. I have trouble sleeping. I had times where I did not eat much, and now I am overeating and bingeing, cannot get myself to cook real food or clean. I got fat, and hate myself. I cannot stand it anymore. I am tired and want it to finally end. it is such a horrible feeling because I KNOW how I will die, I know I WILL kill myself. it is just a matter of time, I just do not know when exactly it will happen. Its hard, but I know I really do not have much time left because living is just unbearable. I do not know why I wrote this, but I guess it is good to get it off my chest or smth. Just a rant.",1
"Ok, I know this is a hot button topic but I was screwed when I was 12/13 and have had to register as a sex offender since then. I am 38 now. Original conviction happened out of state, and if I were in that state I would not have to register anymoreI know its a hot button issue, but if there is any criminal attorney that would be willing to provide me with advice Id greatly appreciate it. Clearly, I am poor as hell - otherwise Id hire someone to deal with this.And please do not judge me, I was 12/13 when I signed the confession because the officers said I would never see my family again if I did not, and when the court finalized it I was 15. Then a few years ago I was raped for the third time, and from that experience ended up with HIV. I just do not think I have the strength anymore. After dating a heroin addict, getting him help and watching him relapse - is that all I am good for? To be used and abused by everyone?

"Severe content warning for mentions of eating disorders and emotional abuse.I have had binge eating disorder for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was a child, I would eat large amounts of food to cope with stress, as I have been in an abusive household my whole life. I have always known this was a problem, and I have tried to lose weight, but my eating habits feel uncontrollable. they have caused many problems, and in 2019, I was diagnosed with morbid obesity.I knew my problems were getting more grave than ever, and my parents rather than trying to help in any way, have scolded me, yelled at me and denied it being related to my mental health, and even denied that I had any mental health problems.It was not until late 2020 where they started taking my mental health even remotely seriously as I had a severe depressive episode that resulted in me not eating. I then got a professional counselor, and I was diagnosed with depression, general anxiety, and PTSD. I was prescribed prozac/fluoxetine to help with this. Even after getting therapy and professional help, my eating habits have not changed. Fluoexetine has also helped me gain more weight.Recently I have been struggling to breathe. Whenever I realized that my health has gotten this bad, I started bawling. I started to feel like my days are limited and that I am going to die before I could turn things around.Truly, I do not want to die. I have many friends I care for dearly and I want to at least live somewhat of a life for myself and escape my abusive home. However, I do not know if I will be able to make things better for myself, and I looked up the costs of oxygen, in which costs more a day than my family makes per month. Making me feel like I have no other options than to die slowly and painfully or by my own hands. tl;dr: I have had horrible eating habits since childhood that my abusive family has refused to get me help for it for a long time that have gotten so bad that they have resulted in breathing problems, and I cannot afford medical help so I feel as if all I can do is die slowly or end my own life myself. I feel like I am dying slowly",1

"I know exactly the day I am going to do it. There are several reasons why I have chosen this date. First, my best friend of 12 years is getting married and I will be his best man in November. Second, I want to see my family for Christmas one last time. I am going to drive myself somewhere relatively far and shoot myself in the head while in my car. I carry the suicide note I have already written in my wallet. I break down and cry every day. I think about dying almost every minute of the day. I do not sleep well, I will not eat for days at a time. I have lost all motivation and hope for the future. I am 24 years old and I have no desire to continue to live. I am only afraid that I will end my life before this date. I have spoken with suicide hotline several times this month. Only to keep myself alive until the end of December. I think about my plan everyday and its the only kind of mental relief I feel. I hope to die leaving my loved ones with good memories of me. Its hard to fake being okay. I am only staying alive for them. Unfortunately they are not enough to keep me going. I am certain I will end my life. I am going to end my life in December.",1
"that is normal. Not. I have always hated myself and my life so much ever since i was a kid. Suicidal thoughts ever since i was a kid. It just gets worse the more i age. I am quite broken. My mind tormented and plagued by past trauma and existential crises. it is so appealing to escape the suffering of life and the suffering of my mind. I was planning to travel to some places i really wanted to see before i die. Like the pyramids and the great wall of china. But now I am wondering, why bother. I feel a bit like a coward in not wanting to go through with a painful suicide method like hanging. I just want to leave this world peacefully. I am not sure which method yet. Some kind of gas probably, that is always been one of the main ones i have been interested in. But there is still quite a bit of preparation you need to do for this method like obtaining the gas and then setting up the method. Whether an exit bag or something. Exit bag sounded good, but looking at people in them it seems a bit morbid now. Like your last moments of vision will be in a bag. I am not sure. I am researching about suicide methods on my birthday",1
I think I am asexual unfortunately. I just want to be like everyone else. I want normal feelings. I hate myself for this. I want to kms. I hate this. I want to be normal. Why am I like this,1

Sometimes I even think about committing Murder-Suicide.Afterwards I always punch myself for thinking about such pathetic ideas &amp; I hate myself for thinking about devastating a 53 year old woman who just wants to see her kid grow up.

"I am a minor with a mom who is fatphobic. I am being constantly told every couple of fucking hours how my thighs are too big, always told that i look like i gave birth to 9 children. She constantly compares our arms and saying mine was bigger than hers. That i have too many stretch marks. She always tells me that when I am an adult I would thank her for all that she is saying and i would regret my body so much. She just told me i was gaining a flabby big lower belly and i should immediately exercise. My dad is a bit better but i think that is only because we do not talk much, only a couple of times a week and 50% of our conversation is just him reminding me of how fat i am and how I would die of obesity. My sister tells me to 'just lose weight' as if i do not want to already. she is been skinny her whole life even when she eats even more than I do. It just feels like she is mocking me.I want to work on myself and i really do want to change. But i just want to lose weight when i am HAPPY, when i can love myself for who i am, where i do not need to wait for midnight to cry and vent mental breakdowns every night just so they cannot hear me. When I do not get anxiety every time i try to dress up because i feel like a whale trying to fit in barbie clothes.I am not even obese. I am just 10kg over the normal weight range for my age. And I feel like I can lose this weight when i try to. But I am just not in the right mindset right now. I cannot try and force myself to exercise without my self loathing getting even more intense when i see myself. I hope that people who says 'losing weight is easy if you just put your mind to it' sees this. I KNOW I am fat. I know i need to lose weight. I know myself and my body more than you do. I deal with more than just my weight. It comes with extreme self loathing, anxiety, and even depression. The mental burden we deal with cannot be easily cured by losing weight. So I do not need the constant reminder of how ugly and unhealthy my body looks because it just adds on to my existing self-hate. Family is the main reason i want to kms",1
"only thing holding me back is the debt i would leave my family. just want to pay that off and leave them with as much as i can so i do not leave any sort or burden, at least any more than i already will just need to take care of one thing before i completely turn the light off",1
"it is been 3 days since I have been planning to cut myself and lose a ton of blood til death. But I always think of the expenses my family will spend just because of ending my life :/ idk. it is so hard to sleep every night with bombarded thoughts. I am already 21 and how come i still do not know how my future going to be. Stopped college for 2 years, been waking up doing the same shit routine like eat, wash dishes, sleep then eat again. Applied jobs that will not accept me. Looked for sponsors for my college unfortunately I lack requirements. Applied scholarship for axie for about a month already. Idk. It is so hard to see my fellow schoolmates are progressing then here is me, doing fucking nothing. My life is more deserving to those who die. I am just wasting my life. I am so done.I hope you could send help to my fam if I already end my life tonight. It sucks to know that it is expensive to die",1

Any suggestions? And do not try to say do not kill yourself, there is help out there. I have seeker help and it did not work at all. I am miserable and just want to end this shit. What would the least painful way be? I have decided to kill myself",1

I have some really good friends from high school but everyone at uni is so awful and I hate everyone there and they make it so hard to exist and god I do not want to work with any of them I just want to die.And then just the thought of actually doing work again sounds awful, I feel so useless but I just cannot understand this course properly, and it is all messed up because of COVID.This year has been awful and I do not know if I will ever be able to get paid work because I am so dumb.I am just sitting on the couch thinking about how I should die. I get overwhelmed by the dumbest things",1
it is 1:20 in the morning here and I cannot sleep. Can somebody please talk to me? Is anybody here?,1
"I honestly do not know.I do not know if contemplating suicide as an option relentlessly makes me suicidal or not.I do not know what would happen if I committed suicide.What I do know is that I want to commit suicide, because damn, life is hard. Soaking up everyone elses emotions is hard. Feeling like you are too young to die is hard.Losing those that you have called friends is hard. Cutting contact is hard. Being called indecisive and unable to say goodbye and move on is hard. Being ignored is hard. Being in a relationship, romantic or otherwise, is hard.I have had really bad experiences in the past. One of who I thought were my closest buddies gaslighted me for years. I was always bullied and ignored. I have recently moved to another school and things have been easier, but I am afraid to trust anyone, so I have been pushing people away because the easier it is to convince myself that I am not their friend makes it easier when I mess up and the relationship burns down. And I have dropped hints everywhere that I want support but nobody ever noticed. Even going to a therapist is hard because I do not trust the therapist enough to tell her anything about how I am feeling because that information invariably ends up in my parents hand. And I do not trust my parents with a single atom in my body. Because some part of teenage me does not trust adults. Because I do not want anyone to worry about me, because in the end this is my burden to carry.So yeah. I have been contemplating suicide. I have even written a draft of a letter to share with certain people I have once felt even remotely close to trusting. I have been getting no sleep at all lately. I have researched the afterlife to try and see what it may be like after I die. So what now?I guess there are two options. To do it, or not to.that is all I wanted to share. Thanks for bearing with me. When trust issues meet suicidal thoughts",1
"So I have been diagnosed with panic disorder, severe depression, and I also have horrible anger issues that just make me feel like shit afterwards. For a few years now my depression and anger have taken a bad fucking turn. it is gotten so bad that I have been pounding brick walls and getting into fights as a form of self harm/punishment (stupid I know but it also keeps the anger in check).About four months ago I stopped taking my meds, I mean they barely helped me anyway. No one really knows what is been going on with me and I think that is for the best. I am about to start college in about a month and I am extremely tempted to kill myself before then.Days just blure together and the faces of friends start to lose their meaning. I honestly feel like I am out of options at this point and I do not know what to do. I wish the best for everyone that reads this but I do not believe that anything good is in the cards for me. My only constant emotions are rage and utter sadness and no amount of support can change that.",1

I do not know what happen this month I look at my hands after dealing with eczema for ducking years and seeing all the marks and wrinkles it left and all the names I was called makes me want to cry to sleep. I cannot stop thinking about it it will never go way I tried everything it will never go away I told people to focus on there skin cuz maybe if I cared about my skin instead of school I would be still here Importance of self care do not be like me,1
yep. my life is so meaningless. my friends/ family are better without me. i want to be ruby lane. i want to slit my wrists like ruby lane from fear street,1
"Again, I really do not want to seem like an asshole, because I know some people are just trying to help, but its incredibly frustrating to me and I often feel patronized in spite of myself. I know the majority of these people do it to come off as an objectively good person, and care little for people who are actually suffering in this way. I hope this does not come off as overly pessimistic, but I really cannot stand shirts or whatever that say you matter or you are loved",1
"I currently live in the you.S. with my mother and my partner is from Poland. I would like to move in with them but it is a huge step that has given me a lot of anxiety. I think its time for me to commit to the decision or else I will end my life.I currently live with my mother. she is quite abusive in a few ways and she constantly controls my life. I am a gamer so of course I love to game and I can spend a lot of time on that. My anxiety and depression is preventing me from being able to continue college. I had to drop out after one semester due to it causing me to attempt suicide. I still do not feel ready to go back. I am 19 and due to the fact that I live under my mothers roof its unfortunately her house and her rules. I do not know if she means well the majority of the time. She says she wants the best for me and wants me to be something in life but just because I am not going to college right now does not mean I will never go, I am just not ready. She constantly takes her anger out on me and never apologizes. I often feel uncomfortable living with her and stay locked alone in my room. She gets upset if I sleep in late but that is my choice because I am not feeling well. I often stay up late and sleep in late, why should it matter to her?My experience with therapy has been awful. It took me contacting 10 therapists to even get one response. During therapy I have just been judged and my issues compared with others, and it has never helped. I had one psychiatrist tell me to just stop gaming completely when I use it to cope with how shit life is. My psychiatrist told me yesterday that my partner will leave me for being useless and not having a job. She also told me that if my mother were to die Id be taken advantage of and used in the system. It feels so fucked up that she would say those things to me. All I could do was cry. If I am being honest, I wanted to shout fuck you and punch her, but I somehow had restraint not to do that.I am 19. I have a lot left to life (and honestly I fucking hope I do not but Ill just say that because of reality) and just because I do not have a job nor am attending college now does not mean I am worthless. I do not understand why my life has to be controlled and I have to be forced to do things I am not ready for. College makes me suicidal, and so does my mother. I feel like its time to move out.The reason I am coming here to post about this is because is it really the right choice? I know there will be yes and nos, but I want to hear what others opinions are. I have been with my partner for just over 2 years and I have been thinking about this major decision for over a year. It gives me quite a bit of anxiety. I have never been to Poland, but we have met twice (would have been more if it were not due to the pandemic). I do not have anywhere else to go. My family is toxic as hell and none of my friends really have space for me to be there. I also will not be able to bring my cats with me if I choose to go. it will be a huge lifestyle change too. My partner has constantly reassured me that they will take care of me and I will have time to improve my mental health before I start making any big steps into the work force or college. Honestly, I feel like Id feel more comfortable doing things if I was there with them, because I love them and I am comfortable with them. I just do not know if making a drastic change to a different country will be worth it in the long run. I do want to move away from my mother but its so far and its so different. I do not want to judge. I just hope that I will be happy if I make that choice, even though I know it will be a lot of stress and anxiety. I am hoping that it will improve my mental health in the long run and allow me to actually be able to control my life and be able to breathe. Maybe Ill actually find a competent therapist and psychiatrist there that are not pieces of shit.I am writing this calm as fuck right now but in reality my brain is spinning. I do not want to go back to my piece-of-shit psychiatrist in a week. If I cannot move out, I genuinely will kill myself, and I feel like moving is the better choice because knowing me Id fail and turn into a vegetable. : )I genuinely do want to die all the time, but I feel like if I can actually enjoy life it would be worthwhile staying at the same time. I want to make the right choice. I can move out but if I do not Ill kill myself",1
"but I have tried every imaginable means to get over it for so long to no avail. I still cannot convince myself that I can live without a life partner. Every fleeting conversation with a woman gives me hope that is immediately dashed. Every time I hear other people setting each other up, I want to jump in front of a train. I even try to stay home and avoid women as much as possible, but that leads to other things that remind me of them.there is just no way out of this. I cannot even kill myself because there is always the carrot of tomorrow, maybe tomorrow I will meet the one, but deep down I know there is no hope, I cannot compete with other dudes. I have accepted as fact that I will never marry",1
my life is so meaningless. my friends/ family are tired of me. i never get better. i cannot even tell them its bad again. or ill let them down. i feel that they are better without me. i feel so alone. and i feel like a failure. i want to slit my wrists like ruby lane from fear street. rant i guess,1
Anyone? Please i just want someone Can I just complain to someone about my loneliness tonight?,1
"Lol, you all should be glad …",1
"No, it will not get better. you will find someone eventually. No, I will not. I have not yet. No one wants to be with me and I think I have a lot to offer. This shit fucking sucks. I hate my life. I hate being alone. I regularly think about ending it all. Only reason I have not pulled the trigger yet is my pets. I am sick of being single and lonely, I fucking hate my job and I hate everything in my life other than my pets and a few friends. I am destined to be forever alone. I am so tired of empty platitudes",1
"I really wanted to go to my newly-discovered favorite shop by myself tomorrow, I have got some ideas of nice things I wanted to get that might help make me feel better, in an area that feels good and right. I think I need to make it through the night so that I can do that. If I do stupid things tonight, then I cannot go. If I hurt myself too badly I cannot go. If I do something stupid I cannot go. I need to at least make it through for that. I think I want to do this tomorrow..",1
"it seems like everything nowadays makes me want to die. i cannot remember the last time i was ever happy, like I am always in a state of depression or disassociation. i do not find anything i do to be interesting or fun; if anything the things i do during the day are just white noise for time to pass by. i have no friends and an abusive family. i feel invisible every single day. I have noticed that all the posts i look at for solutions to a quick painless death are just so demeaning. they make it seem like your the one that is stupid and brainless. honestly makes me want to die more, which is ironic since those posts themselves practically beg you to stay alive...this post is not really anything, i just needed to vent. thinking about overdosing soon but there is no deadline for that i do not want to exist",1
"Everything I do I just feel annoyed, irritated, lose interest and lose focus. I feel weak and tired. I tried sleeping. But i wake up shortly after when i had this short dream. There was a rope from the ceiling. A thick rope. I was in my bed and the rope was hanging beside me. I do not know why but in that dream I grabbed the rope and it suddenly tightened around my neck and i cannot breathe. I keep struggling. And then i found myself on my bed again. Every time i try to sleep all i can think of is how i accidentally commit suicide in different ways and i cannot go back. If only I am not afraid of what comes after. If only i do not have to keep having these feelings and thoughts. Why am i so ungrateful with my life.. I get that feeling again.",1
"I never got rid of a lot of my remaining pills, like mental health pills, totally forgot which ones but I have a bucket of them and they are feeling tempting to figure out how much it would take...

Like that is bad right to think about Using all the pills I have not discarded is a bad idea right?",1

"I will be using letters instead of names.my friend N is the reason I am alive today, we have been friends for a long time and hes the closest friend i have ever had. i introduced him to my online friend T a month or two ago and they have been inseparable ever since. i cannot text either of them because they say that they cannot talk because they are talking to the other. so I am all by myself now. i tried to kill myself a little while ago but it did not work. i thought, ""well even if it did not work, maybe something will change"".nothing has changed. in fact things have only gotten worse. I am being completely ignored. i lost two valuable friends. T because i was an idiot and introduced him to N, and N because I am not enough. N was the only thing keeping me alive, and now that I have been replaced i do not have anymore value. but what if i try and fail again? what then? all I will have accomplished is making everyone around me feel like shit. i do not know what to do anymore i feel so stuck. i wish i was never even born, so many people could have lived a better life if i was not born. I am just an expendable sack of flesh and bones why should anyone care about me. i cannot believe i ever thought i was important to N. it was stupid of me really. I have never been important to anyone so why did i think he was different? even so, he is the most amazing person I have ever met and i will never forget him. i hope he knows thatidk what else to say i think I am done. anyone got something to say that might be helpful? i did not realize i could be so easily replaced",1
i wrote out my will and chose the way i want to go I am just sitting and waiting for the day. i still have a lot to throw out but I am going to leave a few things behind that ppl can still get use out of. it feels relieving to know I will not be suffering so greatly anymore soon. the worst is knowing everyone who did not care about you when you were around are going to be up in arms when you are gone it irks me to think about but not enough to keep me alive lol. i picked a day,1
"So I broke up with my boyfriend, telling him I need a break. The reason being I am only 22 and hes 27 and he wants to be with me forever, he said I am the one for him. I have a disorganised attachment style. Meaning I am pulled between desperately wanting affection (anxious) to not wanting any affection at all and wanting to just end the relationship because I feel its an attack on my independence (avoidant) he said he loves me and will wait for me. I said I will only need a few weeks or a month or something to get myself together. I just feel locked in, like I am so young and will be with this person forever. Hes perfect for me. When I was feeling suicidal once he took 2 days off work to be with me to make sure I am okay. Hes a good communicator, he cares and loves me. there is no drama as I am used to in other relationships. So anyway, the night I broke up with him I got insanely drunk and ended up going to a former FWB house and had sex with him. I also messaged one of my co workers for sex.. so embarrassing because hes the type that will tell EVERYONE at work and make me look like a desperate slag. Then the next day I had to work, despite being super hung over. Like not in the sick way, just my whole body could not stop shaking. Whenever I tried to serve a customer id shake uncontrollably and had to go out the back and I ended up crying. Anyway to sum it all up, I am embarrassed, like I need to quit my job right now because I never want to face any of them again and feel like my coworkers probably think I am crazy and stupid. Although they do know the reason I was acting that way. But now all I want to do is die. I have slept for almost 24 hours, the most I have ever slept in my life. I woke up a few times but could not bear putting up with the thoughts so I went back to sleep. I feel like I have made a big mistake. I have screwed up being with a guy that is perfect for me, just because of my need for independence and wanting to sleep around.. like how ridiculous and selfish. My life is a mess. I have no friends and no one that cares. All I want to do is take a bottle of pills and die. Please help. I broke up with my boyfriend 2 days ago, now I feel so suicidal. Please help.",1

Please help me. I just cannot fucking deal with it anymore,1
I just want to take all my pills tomorrow when my husband is gone for work and not show up to my job. Will they even fucking care. Ot I will slit my wrists in the tub. Noting helps my cat is dying and it is my fault I cannot help himI've failed my marriage with my fucking problemsHe'll be better riff without me I just want to die,1
Death does not scare me nor does any shitty thing that could occur in life. Fear can no longer limit me. Being suicidal is a positive feeling for me because nothing scares me anymore,1
"they are really cool and I am literally so alone and I feel like I have to, I cannot just keep sitting here and hoping I die, I also cannot just die and I cannot just cut again. This is stupid and life is stupid and I do not want it. And I cannot really talk about this to people I know, I wrote a message reaching out to my friends and it is sitting there unsent. I do not even want to eat. I have a binge eating issue and I have not been eating or feeding myself all week, which is really weird. I think I am really like giving up lol. I have health anxiety and there are a few things going on and I wish they would just take me out but they are like not deadly or anythingI'm so hungry and nothing.... nothing is something I want to eat, I do not want anything. I feel like someone I really trust is walking all over me and I cannot do anything about itIs this life?? Why?? Fuck, I do not want it. The skin on my fingers are all bitten off at this point, I do not care. I might care in the morning but I do not right now. I am not even in my mid twenties yet and I want to fucking die. Is not eating some sort of silent protest? it is stupid because no one knows but me. God I just do not want this, it is all pain, all of it. And I am going to yell into the void about it Finally reaching out and texting the trevor project again",1
"I see no way out of my shitty life. I am planning to end it all soon. How can I stop? I am planning my suicide, how to stop?",1
"I could never leave, and not be certain my kids will be okay, but I do not want to do this anymore. I should not wake up every single morning more and more upset that I did wake up. I cannot remember the last time I felt happy... or even okay. I make it through the days for my kids, but I feel like I could be a much better mom if I did not want to die. Maybe I would have more motivation to play, or actually cook dinner more than once every few weeks. But everything is too much. I feel so alone and have very little help.. feeling like a shitty mom doe help. I need a break... but even if the opportunity came up, I would feel guilty for leaving my kids, especially a newborn. How do I know the difference between postpartum depression and regular depression? Is this going to get better in a few months? I am not okay and I have no one.. Postpartum?",1
please anyone. i just want to be cared ab and loved. i have no one. no one cares until its too late and I am getting to the point where death seems better than this shit. no one thinks ill do it but when i do they will wish they paid more attention to it and they will wish they could have stopped it. i have no one. I have been having these thoughts since i was in 4th grade. I am now a junior in high school. people think I am a happy person and I am always okay but I am trying so hard to keep everything in. recently I have been giving so many warning signs that are so blatantly obvious i do not know what else to do. no one thinks you will do it until its too late.,1

"Final answer to constant discomfort. After a Trauma, head is all fkd up. Headaches that go from basic to piercing. They just will not quit. Just here to torture me. Lots of Therapy and they say its all up to me. Be positive. Yeah right. Nice touch to flip the game against the client. How the hell can I do that? If I could do that, why would I see a therapist? To tell me I have to fix myself? A bum on the street can tell me that for free . No appointment needed. No violent methods here. Have it set up to go in my sleep. Peaceful. I was holding out to spare those around me that may be affected but at the end of the day, its just you all alone and your own decision path. going to END IT. GET DAILY HEADACHES",1
I never asked for such a bad life like this. I think I am going to kill myself.,1
"I have known a long time now that suicide is for me. That sounds really weird, but essentially, I genuinely feel my birth was a mistake and I do not belong on this planet. I am tired of trying to fit in just to feel something only for it to backfire and because me more pain. The fact I need antidepressants feels like more of a conformation that I do not belong here than anything. Death is the answer.I would have done it over a year ago, but I bought into the propaganda and got help. I have been basically shuffling my feet waiting for something to happen ever since. And I am done.it will probably be a few months at the latest. Now I get to have all the fun of planning my perfect last day and the lead up. Yay. Probably going to do it soon.",1
"No one love me anymore. that is all, I am now unloved forever Worth it",1
"I was going to hang myself last sunday but I got too scared and did not. I fucking hate myself for being a coward, I could not even do that. I fucking hate that, I hate myself, I do not know why I am like this, but now I know better and how to deal with this mindset. I am determined to do this, I have a full plan now. I am not going to run away this time I was too afraid to take my life the first time",1
"I have not been happy in so long. I have been sleeping all day because being awake takes too much effort. When I cannot sleep I just do drugs because at least that is better than being sober. I am going to college in 3 weeks and I have no idea if I am ready and I do not want to go. I have always felt alone even though I have always had friends, nobody gets me and the one person who does is my gf of 3 years who is going to college a ways away from me. I have been wanting to die for so long and I feel like hopeless and unhappy. I want to die",1
"This is a long post and is all over the place. I have to rant as I cannot ever physically say my emotions or feelings and therefore cannot tell my own therapist about this or anyone really. I have been suicidal since I was at least 13. There are notes as far back as 9 saying I might as well die to my doctors. My home life was never good.I have always said Ill die by 40 if I make no progress but it often feels like the earlier the better. My guilty conscience leads me to wait until my family is older. I have been struggling with burnout and usually no one notices in my family and ignores me (probably my fault since I get irritable). For reference, I am autistic (aspergers), have ADHD, anxiety and depression. The latter three since I was 6 years old. My little sister came into my room tonight and made me dinner (leftovers, she knows I do not eat regular meals. I forget or food just is not appealing.. I am very picky and she knows me by now). Pretty sure she heard me crying and saw me cry earlier today, but its making me cry more that she even noticed. Maybe she did not notice but I know she caught on as I was crying as she brought me food. I know I have my own issues, but both of my little siblings are or have been suicidal and hospitalized and I just do not want to add on any pressure to anyone in my family. My older sister has a kid and a divorce at a young age and is unstable in many ways. But I am 25 now and its breaking me feeling so alone and I cannot be perfect. I have had to put on a show since my two little sisters came into my life when I was 15 when my mom got married (which I would not ever trade it was a good thing). I got my act together but instead just have the same issues I did at age 9 at age 25 and have not progressed socially at all. I have not dated. Never been asked out. I lose friends due to being impulsive and saying the wrong things. People say I am nice but somehow all of my relationships are superficial. No one reaches out to me for actual conversation unless they need something. I realized I am starting to suffer severe burn out. Doctors notes say at age 13 I said Ill stay in my room and just not talk. I have done that since and did not even know I saw that. My memory itself it very poor. But here is the catch. How do you deal with burn out when you cannot ever express your true emotions? I always lie on impulse and say I am watching a sad movie (which is what I did today and I referenced a movie I cried to recently called Ride Your Wave). I do not think I can be vulnerable. Therapy and medicine has not helped this because I am too stubborn to open my mouth and say more that the bare minimum. I either lie or get so angry if I have to express the truth, so I never express the truth. The anger is really me just being overwhelmed and I know that others cannot take that well and resent me for it. I was chastised far too often and hit too often as a kid for my fits. To be fair, I hit too. My parents never cared for positive reinforcement or bothered learning how to soothe a mentally ill child. My mother never listened to my doctors when they said she should try complimenting me for once (they legit said this as she was negative in my doctor appointments).How can I be vulnerable when no one ever took me serious enough when I struggled the most and it came off as anger? I got tossed aside so my little sisters could get the help they needed since I got good grades. My own stubbornness makes it so no one wants to help me or ask how I am or how I feel. I just answer I am fine. Its stifling. I never meant to push anyone away but why does no one ask me how I am or press further? It hurts. Sometimes I hate living with these conditions and nights like tonight when my little sister came into my room give me some hope. I am not completely hopeless, but 10 (25) years of working my ass off to feel like I have not gotten anywhere socially and I still cannot cook well and cannot get out of my room. People say to just try/do it. I try it and fail I get overwhelmed and cannot do it again. I am trying hard and they know I am behind but it seems I can only help myself but I just have not been able to. I know at this point I need to do things alone but how do I start? Not to mention there is no new psychiatrist available until October. Online ones exist but cannot prescribe the stimulant I take. I am just stuck. Thanks for reading. I am just not sure Ill be here when I am middle age if I do not progress or even a year. Being behind is hard and people make fun of you if you are a picky eater or are a creature of habit but I cannot help it. Why cannot people be more understanding. Why cannot I understand myself. Its a two way compromise but I am so stubborn I get nowhere. How much longer?",1
And that is fucking disgusting. This is why the world should be hit by a meteorite and destroy the scum of humanity. People make fun of suicidal people,1
"I will not lie, I put on a good poker face so that when people look at me it seems like my life is sunshine and rainbows. Hell, I have even had people tell me that it seems like I live a fun life. I am young, fit, pretty successful for my age, and not an ugly looking person. Underneath all of this, there is an insecure little boy that suffered from sexual assault as a child, severe bullying, had an eating disorder for 8 years, has mentally abusive parents/has been in toxic relationships, and has panic/anxiety attacks every night. I do not actually have any close friends despite having people that want to be friends with me. When I try to talk to people, it does not feel genuine or they have this expectation of me based on my image that does not reflect who I am as a person. Its exhausting that people think I am a huge ball of fun energy and loves to party, that is not who I am at all. And when they find out how I actually am as a person, it sucks because I literally see them lose interest in me. My family raised me and distilled values of perfectionism and reputation to the point that they stripped me of any bit of originality. When I try to be myself around them, I get told I am being weird or what will people think about you. My own mother calls me ugly and points out the smallest imperfectionsI go on dates and people just want to have sex with me for my body, and when I want to develop an emotional connection I get blown off - often times because the other side did not expect me to be as emotional as I am and it scares them. I feel like I have no one to be vulnerable with and it makes me feel so unbelievably lonely. The thing is, I do not think I have ever felt like I was not lonely. Who am I living for? What am I even working so hard for? How did I even get this far? On the outside everything looks perfect",1
"Whenever I see couples, whether online or in person, I instantly get an intense wave of sadness. I soon start to dwell over it and I start to get suicidal ideation. Love is the one thing in my life that is lacking, I can never get a boyfriend no matter how hard I try. Its also the main reason why I am suicidal. Does anyone else ever feel this way whenever they see lovers? I am having one of those nights and I want to die. Couples",1
"I work in a shop. Its not even been a month yet I have already come to hate my job, I feel so broken down and just totally drained, physically and emotionally. I cry every morning before I leave for work, and I sobbed my eyes out in the bathroom yesterday for the entire lunch break. I am in the bathroom crying again now. I would literally give anything to be able to quit. I was 16 the last time I attempted suicide and I am honestly getting really strong suicidal thoughts now, I feel so trapped and helpless and alone. Crazy thing is I used to work in 2 other shops before and I loved my job then, I really do not know what went wrong this time. I am desperately unhappy at my job, to the point where I am considering suicide.",1
"I am just so tired of living, everything is just so,,,apathetic almost gray if that makes sense idk.I have isolated myself from all my friends, i just sit around all day and be a waste of space to my family, my bf is probably bored of me, what have i actually contributed to this world ??? literally nothing.I am useless, waste of everyone is time and money, I am nothing, i do not matter, nothing matters anymore nothing matters.",1
I hate who I am right now at age 28. I feel like I failed highly in my relationships family peers etc. I hate having autism with disabilities and mental illness. I am Catholic and try to keep my faith. Highly feeling suicidal ideation,1
"I cannot live with my anxiety anymore, I cannot handle it.. not in a life like this, I just hope if there is something after this life it will be more kind to me then this life was, everything I have had to go through in my life has lead to nothing but more suffering, more pain. it is a cruel fucking random game life is. I do not see any reason to live anymore, nobody In my house listens to me, I guess talking to me about literally fucking ANYTHING is the most difficult thing ever, every. GOD DAMN. THING. yet they can criticize me however they want, I am lazy, I am Ignorant, I am negative, I am crazy.. fucking assholes. some people were not meant to be fucking parents, I will tell you that right now.. sharing anything with them is like talking to a god damn brick wall, my entire life you have just yelled at me and never pushed me to do anything out of my comfort zone. Now because of that I am, just useless... that is all I will ever be,I do not have any friends either, nobody who gives a fuck enough to listen to me anyways, which Is fine. I do not expect anyone to be friends with a mentally ill depressed awkward fucking retard tbh, if I was in their shoes I would probably do the same, so no hard feelings there :) part of me feels bad for doing this now considering what just happened in my mom's family 4 days ago.. I wish I could push myself to stay a little longer and did not have to put her through losing someone else, but I do not think I would be able to help her anyway.. I feel like putting her through this now instead of later when she just started healing would be less-cruel, but I do not know.. I just hope my dad will be able to help her through this, but I cannot continue, I do not want to continue.. I do not want to waste so much pointless fucking energy just to grow old and die alone, I do not want to continue living In a fucking awful home filled with people who do not even acknowledge me, I do not want to continue being alone while everyone around me has some connection to something or someone... so, I am done. I do not want to continue, I am pissed, I am depressed, I am done.",1
"I might vent a lot, but mostly I do not want to feel alone tonight even tho i am Can someone please talk to me?",1
I do not want to live anymore what is the point. My family does not give a shit about me they tell me I am weak all the time since I was a kid. I feel worthless. I cannot handle these fucking emotions. Dying keeps seeming like a better option than living. I feel so so worthless what is the point i do not feel loved by my family they constantly put me down and criticize me. I am not happy with living i do not want to be here. I do not want to live,1
"(23 M) I come to this sub every now and then for something to relate to, to hear about people who seem to be experiencing life the way I am. It does not matter what life events are occurring, good or bad, people of all ages are impacted by depressive thoughts and ultimately suicidal ideation. I really do not know if I could ever do it. I think about it all the time, even while enjoying the time I spend alive. Recently more than ever it just seems like a real possibility, something to almost look forward too. I cannot think about it without thinking about the people who know me and love me, the problems it may because for them is the main reason I do not do it. When I think about it I also think about the larger picture, the reality of this situation. I understand that even in our darkest moments, tormented by our thoughts and clinging to life by whatever threads we have left, we still do things like this, like reaching out on this sub. As small as this action is, its so powerful. Everyone reaching out and opening up on this thread is so powerful, so desperate to live. Even when all hope is seemingly lost, we compile our thoughts and essentially throw a lifeline in an attempt to save our own lives. Think about how amazing that is, even if we feel so unloved, so hopeless, so lost, ashamed, abandoned, dreadful, or sorry, we still reach out in order to save our own lives. We reach out to beautiful strangers on this app to assist us in this journey of life, to give us just something, anything to survive, or at least make it easier to live a little longer. We are our own friends, we are the people who unconditionally love ourselves, we are programmed to keep fighting, typing a message and sending it on this sub is a huge testament to our strength as humans. You may want to die, but in the most sincere and loving way I can possibly say this, you reach out here, you read these messages because you simply want to live. I hope that no matter what you choose to do in your life you realize the power you have over yourself and your ability to change your own world. You are your own beautiful lifeline, whether you realize that or not. Here I am again",1

Does anyone have any tips for anxiety and suicidal thoughts? Tips,1
"This will probably be my last post, I feel no reason to live, my life is just empty, I am going to stab myself. I am going to kill myself.",1
"I had a fairly decent life untill i grow up and I always helped people who had a idea of killing themselves many times back in highschool so this is not a random topic for me, I believe I have changed many people's mind and helped them get better but for the last few years things started to fell off one by one.What exactly do I mean by started to fell off? The girl I met in high school and then become lovers died after 4 years of dating after high school, family is also non existant, had health issues etc.I was pretty okay with many stuff starting the life without a lack of family, having hard time to find my place in the social life and such and always felt strong enough to deal with everything but as the time goes I just got tired of being strong, acting strong, trying to implement myself in to social life and finding people to bond with have a good time with.And recently by losing the last person I felt some connection to the world being gone and myself having some health issues that may or may not be important, having to lose all my friends and now that not being able to find new people and such, I just got really tired, really tired, I carried so much stuff as a child and a grown up but somehow I am now exhausted I never thought I will be this tired in life like ever.I always been a observer but I am tired of being one because I cannot fit myself in to anything nowadays and I am tired of seeing people being happy with something/someone I started to get jealous and question my life and found the details I ignored all this time.That questioning part lead me to asking; Did I really deserved everything? Because should not that be go like, bad things happen then you get some happiness and then it gets a straight line for normal and always climbs up for people who are extremely lucky. (I know there is no rule this is just a random vent I guess?)I concluded on that I do not deserve to be alive and I do not fit in anywhere in life anymore. So therefore I believe that I should just give up at this point because I had enough, I tried enough, I fought enough.Funny part is I still love life, how things go for people around me as I said I spent so much time observing them and I like how good things going for them etc. I am just tired of mine going flat down with everything, literally everything.I kind of do not expect anything from anyone and I still have like a pages of things that I can talk about and the saddest part is I am aware of literally everything; my situation, what should I do, how I sound etc.Anyways this is the chaos going on in my head that I plan to solve by giving up,Thank you. I think I have arrived the end of this road.",1
"I do not even really know how to say what I want to say. All aspects of my life are fulfilled rn and I have everything physical that I could want (which I do not want a lot so that part is easy) , financially secure, have pets that I love, have a job I love, have a partner, and a part of me feels like that is making life worse. Cos I have no wants or needs right now but I still feel like not being here. I just do not see a point. I feel like my only purpose in life is to make others be happy or do anything that I can to make their life better but it still is not helping much.I just daydream about not being here anymore. There is a quote that I read: Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace. and that is all that I hope for these days. I so badly just want to get a bottle of alcohol, call an uber, go to the nearest bridge and just let go of everything and forget existing. I feel like I was not meant for this world. I do not think I have ever truly been happy. I know nobody can help but I just wish that something could help this. It sucks feeling this way and just constantly wanting to do that. :( Life is so empty sometimes.",1
"But its doubtful anyone does or will again. I am not worth anyones time, idiot loser. I had multiple chances and I sabotaged them all. Sorry if you are reading this. Just move on, I do not want comfort, I want to disappear. I would really like to believe anyone cared",1
"death is really the only truly permanent thing we have. every time I am happy, i know that ill just go back to being sad. that is my default stateevery time i think of anything else, ill inevitably think about my trauma againdeath solves both of those things. i know that nothing awaits me when i die. i cannot think anymore. my trauma cannot haunt me. i will not ever feel happiness, but more importantly, ill never feel sadness. ill never have to feel like i need to starve myself to be pretty again. ill never have to worry again about fucking up my life even worse. its comforting knowing that I am going to end all of that. for the first time, ill have peace every decision i make is wrong and every feeling of joy is fleeting",1
"Like who do i need to proof my worth to? Random strangwr I will never talk to,or myself?I do not know like why tf should i care if others see my worth because i do not see it.

I just cannot anymore I cannot,1
"Kind of hard to explain in full detail, but I kind of always thought I was a worthless piece of shit but also thought ""hey I am kind of better than other people at this one thing"" which was useful as a job so I figured I would just tough life out so my parents would not be sad and all that stuff. But recently I realized that no, actually, you are not very good at your job, you should have been fired years ago, you cannot get a new job, and you are too useless to do anything else. So my options are essentially to leech off my parents for my whole life or be homeless. Or, possibly, constantly get hired on for low wage menial work and be fired within a few weeks for sucking. I choose option 4 as I do not see any value in life anyway. My desire to not have my parents be sad is no longer strong enough to keep me here. Too bad for them that they took the chance and had a child. I am only partially delaying as the method I have chosen could be dangerous to people so I am trying to figure out how to avoid anyone getting hurt. It should be quick and relatively painless though. I just need a very empty space or something to counteract the toxicity after I perish. Of course I would prefer to have nembutal but getting your hands on it is such a hassle and it is hard to be sure you are actually getting nembutal if you try to get it from seedy sources. I bought a shit ton of candy and sweets and am enjoying eating them though, probably actually truly enjoying them for the first time in my life since I am no longer thinking ""boy I should not be eating this crap."" Pretty Sure I will Kill Myself Soon",1

Whenever I get real anxious I find casino games get my mind off it.I just wish I was not my own worst enemy.

"I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I do not have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities did not believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I am their abuser and they are my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I am being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it is killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently cannot go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof. Abused as a child",1

Not able to talk to anyone, have friends; even when doing normally enjoyed things (video games, time off, etc.) all I can think about is how everyone else is probably enjoying their time with other people. Am I working for something or am I just working for the sake of working just because everyone tells me that is what I am supposed to do.

Everyone just tolerates me until a replacement shows up. No one will care when I am gone,1

That cardiac arrest is probably going to hurt like a MF, but my will to live is growing weaker by the day. What is the point of living anymore, I am tired of nightmares every night and the real world. Nicotine overdose might work too. How many cigarettes ad vapes would it take to kill ya? Maybe alcohol would be the better way to go, just get like fifty beers or something maybe a hundred. How bout them other drugs? Not that I have access to them, but that would be nice. I know it is not funny to joke about this kind of stuff, if I did not fear death or the possibility of there being an afterlife, I would be gone in a flash. Well I guess I am slowly killing myself by smoking, so maybe I should stop that. Not that I want to, but I do not want some higher power being like ""hmm, you smoked them cigarettes being fully aware what they do to you? Okay time to send another form of your consciousness to an even worse place MWHAHAHAHA"" Not calling it God, the abrahamic deity called God is so fucking childish, if there was really a creator or high power of some sort, it would not be some dude that said humans were in the image of him, getting angry and jealous, and having three different forms yet saying they are all one. Maybe there is no creator or higher power and the pre-existent bigbang has always existed. I do not know dudes, but I am sick of living, but I do not want to kill myself then become something else within the universe or reality and have dark energy push ""me"" into an even worse place(or I do not know how dark matter dark energy works but something like that) I feel like I am cursed to suffer for all of eternity already. we are already in hell dudes, is it possible to climb the ladder and find the kingdom of heaven from within, I have no idea, but I guess I will try again. Maybe some meditation or something will help me, this world so fucked up yo. How could I possibly know I have not been existent an infinite amount of times? Can you try to think back to what you/it were like before you were born? You cannot, or at least I cannot. Maybe this is really the first time for existence to occur, but there are theories for infinite universes so I do not know. If the universe is possible, then I guess anything is possible. Maybe I am the only one that exists and all of you and everything else is an illusion with my brain and senses acting as filters and playing tricks on me, or maybe I am part of that illusion as well. who is fucking dream is this world? Or is this dream/illusion just self reliant on its own with no one or thing to dream it. An illusion implies that there is an opposite of that like a factuality or actuality or something idk. I am fearful of the unknown, and I do not know anything. I do not have the courage to go through with it. I guess I am not starving in a third world country or enslaved in human trafficking so it could be worse I suppose, I am a whiny kid with a smartphone acting like a little bitch, but I do have my own problems I will not lie. No friends, no partner, work all the time. Idk man. Caffeine overdose.",1
"Back here again. Great. I was doing so well these past few weeks. And by so well, I mean not having the urge to count every building to check if its over ten stories or feeling numb all the time, but here we are. All over poop. I have not been able to shit for the past almost five days and spent the whole day today trying two enemas, a suppository, and laxatives. And nothing. Now, the thought of going to the ER over shitting is so mortifying and stress-enducing that I am back to my thought of just ending it all. The shit is a metaphor. Even when you think things are getting better, there will always be another shit storm waiting. I am so tired. Crying over poop",1

"We cannot even act surprised either. He told all of us how depressed he was. The last time I saw him he said his mind was going to dark places. The way he said it though was so ambiguous. he would always smile and laugh after. Id give a generic response like oh do not say that, or some bullshit. When I found out today though, it hurt in my heart because I have been thinking about it too. I did not tell my friend. I have said the words before to people I considered friends but no one ever knows what to say or says the right thing. What do you do anymore? So much pain and sadness this year. I just found out my friend committed suicide.",1

Its not healthy to hold a grudge this long. If I am already suicidal, why not just TRY to have a better life? Nothing to lose. Should just take the chanceif nothing matters in the end. Ill become a new person and meet new people. Worst case scenario: I fail but still learn and get the experience. And yes, I am going through withdrawals rn. Instead of killing myself, Ill kill them (in my head)",1

I have tried to look up many pro suicide forums but can not find any. As I sit here alone, no friend in my life, losing the love of my life. I just need my life to end. I want it to end.

"My sibling is trans (17, pre-op, ftm, he/them). Our parents are good parents, some bumps here and there. they are opposed to my sibling transition. I support my sibling, but I am not very good with words and kind of a coward. I have a hard time standing up to our dad about it. Our dad is a good man, but he is a butt sometimes. he is so supportive with both of us wanting to pursue artistic careers, teaching us how to be more independent, and will never abandon his us. he is firm about keeping us all together (since he is distanced himself from certain distant family). he is talked us both down from trying to kill ourselves more than once. But he seems so apathetic when it comes to this. I feel guilty for not being able to properly comfort them when they get depressed about it. My sibling and I are both LGBTQ+, are bipolar, have depression, and have anxiety, so I kind of understand how it feels when Dad acts like that. Our Dad has a bisexual sister and loves her (even though she always gets into trouble), so I know he does not hate us for being LGBTQ+. he is not exactly traditional either (he wants his daughters to be independent), so why cannot he be more supportive? I think it is the ""transition"" part he does not like. Maybe he is scared that my sibling will hate that body as well, if not worse. I understand the sentiment, but my sibling is dead set on developing a masculine body. I want to pay for it myself, but cannot. (I am 19, not a guardian, and broke). What can I do to comfort my sibling? Any good advice or thoughts? How do I comfort my trans sibling?",1
"If I did not live with my dad, I would feel better about offing myself. The only reason why I have not attempted yet is because I do not want him to find me before I die. I do not want to risk being severely brain damaged. I wish I lived alone, so it would be easier to hang myself.",1

"There is nothing in my life that i wish more than death yet i am still afraid of doing the thing. I am such a coward, i cannot live a life but i cannot even die, what the hell am i doing here? Seems to me that i am just forced to suffer.I really envy you Americans, living in the land of the free but i especially envy the second amendment of your constitution.If i was born American, i could have bought a shotgun and put an end to this stupid story. But i are not no American and the only way i have to take my life is through something painful or that does not grant instant death. Should i hang myself if i cannot achieve a full suspension? Hell no, low suspension method is too risky, takes too much time and there is always a chance for an ""hero"" to appear... Imagine living a life with a brain that is so rotten it does not allow you to wipe your ass, It would be surprisingly worse than before. Then should i just jump from height? And what if i cannot manage to land on the head? It will be an excruciatingly way to leave this place and i do not want to suffer more than I have already did in my life. What other choices do i have left? I do not know, i am not very smart and i cannot think of a painlessly way to die on my own but if you try to search on the internet for a way to do it, you will only get suicide hotlines numbers and related stuff.Everything related to suicide is literally censored. We basically have no right to die in this sick, cruel world to the extent that we are forced to stay here, just waiting for the death to come. That is sick, why is that so? It feels cruel to force people living a life of pain and suffering, it feels scary to think you do not have the right to take your own life. I am just waiting for the death to come.",1

"What else to add? I did not chose to become pregnant and a single mother. (There is more story to this but I do not want to write too much right now, as it is really traumatic for me)My parents basically pressured me into keeping the child. But tbh I do not know if I would have been able to get a abortion (mentally) if they were not involved.I love my little one. I really do. Now it is too late anyway. I will do my best to care for my baby, but I am suffering. I would honestly kill myself if I were not pregnant/a parent to a child who needs me. How can I manage the pain for at least 18 years from now on? I am only 20 y/o and have no friends. I just have my close family (stepfather, mother, younger brother) and it is currently very stressful at home. They fight a lot and I feel like a burden to them, but I have no alternative, nowhere else to go.They told me that I and their future grandchild can stay with them and they will support me. I would leave and make it easier for them, but I obviously cannot make this decision bc of my LO.I have no other option than staying with them. I am financially unstable and basically a failed human being, not able to care for myself (and my child). I am in a very bad mental state right now and I do not know how to manage anymore (professional help/hospital is no option. I do not have that much money and cannot expect my parents to pay. I already was diagnosed in the past but my parents basically ""undiagnosed"" me, as they know better than all of the mental health professionals I have seen in the past). I feel so bad for even having this kind of thoughts, but I kind of wish I will die due to birth complications. Nobody would consider blaming me.I am such an asshole for even thinking that, I know.I am so sorry my little one. Mummy is trying very hard to stay safe for you. do not worry guys. I would never do intentional harm to myself as long as baby is inside of me. I love him so much and he is the only reason I am still alive. I sadly cannot talk to anyone about this.

"I failed an attempt a week back and have not told anyone or really unpacked it. I broke down when it failed but I have been numb ever since. When I thought I was dying I did not feel scared, I felt relieved. I felt better than I have in so, so long. I found myself dwelling on whether or not anything would happen after I die or if my consciousness would simply cease to exist, and the thought of nothingness did not bother me at all. I cannot believe a week has already passed. Nothing changed. I want to try again, but it is hard to come up with another method in my situation.It bothers me that I have to put so much thought into carefully planning my escape. Why are we forced to live against our will? I would not have to resort to such awful methods if I could be straightforward and honest. Instead, I am paranoid about raising suspicion and have to avoid so many methods that would be quick and painless simply because I cannot risk anyone finding out. it is absurd.Part of me is disappointed that it was so easy to pick myself up and recover from my attempt. Makes me feel like I did not get close at all. The other part of me is glad that I do not have any lasting symptoms. Life does not need to be more painful than it already is.Not sure what this post is supposed to be. This community cannot help me, but at least I can talk about things that I cannot normally talk about. Failed attempt",1

I am the one who wanted help but it causes me so much pressure. I feel like my problems are not enough big and that there are a lot of people who need the help over me. I do not take the advice she gives me and going there I just wait for it to be over. It makes me feel sad when she makes me think about my emotions. I am too tired to go (not because lack of sleeping, I have just had this weird issue of being too tired emotionally and not really able to do shit because of that, do not know why) and it is starting to feel useless to go because I keep most of the things inside of me and overthink. It would be so much easier to just stay at home and act happy. No one understands anyways. I cannot find a way to tell her I do not want to go anymore and at this point I feel like help is useless. It will not help anyways and I am not going to have any dreams for the future because I do not want to stay. I just want to have my last night of sleep, last meal and last gaming session. And then end it all. That would be a thousand times easier and end the pain. I do not really mind dying because I have no dreams and I am just living my boring NPC life.

I am in my early thirties. But I have had chronic suicidal ideation since age 14. I remember the first time as if it were yesterday. Part of me is proud I made it to 33. But I do not think I am going to last much longer. I feel weak for giving into the negative thoughts. But I just do not think I can keep up the facade anymore. I have high functioning ASD (Aspergers) and trying to fit in and form relationships has just grown far too exhausting. Wish you all the best in this subreddit.

"Hopefully my behaviour can help find out why. I tend to be very apathetic, apart from when I am stuck into researching my favourite subject which is nutrition and have become very impatient with my former favourite hobby I engaged in to relieve boredom, which are video games. I have some suicidal ideation, because nutrition can only provide so much information and find it extremely difficult to start new hobbies like learning an instrument. I have so far failed to mention my autism, which I inherited from my purely parental lineage and had diagnosed from a professional and autism has been linked with depression, although I do doubt my diagnosis to a small degree. My heart rate is in the 90s which is a possible indicator that something is wrong with me since higher heart rates are linked with depression, shorter life spans and a greater chance of CVD, although I am exercising and eating some legumes to lower it as much as possible. I am taking lamogtrigine which is supposed to stabilize my mood, as my consultant thinks that I may have Bipolar and I am growing some broccoli sprouts to treat my autism as it is the only shown treatment of autism there is, if I even have it in the first place.(I am whole food starch based, but I understand if you do not want to leave animal products behind, as my oldest sister still likes them.)My main issue with making friends is anticipatory anxiety, possibly induced by church up until we stopped attending, much to the dismay of the pastors at 14 and maybe attending school at 14 after a history of only homeschooling. I am completely fine in the presence of others, like at school and can tolerate them fairly well outside of regular social meetings, but the main reward is walking out of the regular meetings for sure, knowing I have some time before I encounter them again. Quickly going back to nutrition, I think I might be deficient in both calcium and magnesium, which seem to have a role in mood, alongside the obvious ones being bones and muscles and I am also taking ashwaganda. My grandfather on my fathers side, the autistic and very quiet one who only every talked to my mother once in his entire life, thankfully it being the pleasant topic of his civil engineering career. (He shook hands with the queen for an important construction project once, despite being very middle class.) I also have problems falling asleep at regular times, but no issue getting it consistently. I must further mention that I have had severe seperation anxiety based on my mother, to the point where I very rarely could be left with strangers and could not even be held by my own father, who has suffered from general anxiety for as long as he can remember.I grew up in a Christian community and also a completely secular sailing club, which gave me the feeling of being Jekyll and Hyde before having known about the book. But both feelings where equally enjoyable. Although I was in a Christian environment much more. This was balanced out by three and a half years of schooling I suppose, although one of my friends at church who I do not see anymore thought religion was stupid and my mother and I think he could have been autistic. I keep in sparse contact with one friend from my Christian-hood and none of the good friends I made in public school.And yet, after all of my research into nutrition and other lifestyle changes, such as aerobic fitness, what could be the because of my low mood? Any supplements you guys would recommend, as I am also taking boron which is a unessential mineral that boosts testosterone a fair amount among other things.Thanks for reading this long post. What could be causing my suicidal ideation?",1

"Bell Ringer Wanted A beautiful, old church with a tall steeple and bell tower was in need of someone to ring the bell every hour as the priest was getting too old to climb the stairs. He put out a sign asking for someone to fill the position, and an hour later he hears 3 slow thuds on the front door. The priest opens the door to find a man standing there with no arms. He says, ""I am here about the open position, it has always been my dream to ring the bell in this church"". Hesitant, the priest figures he will let the man audition, so they walk all the way to the top of the steeple where the large bell resides. The priest tells the man to go ahead and ring the bell, not sure how he will be able to pull the cord without any arms. The man takes a few steps back, then runs and jumps face first at the bell, and it let out the most amazing ring causing the entire town to stop in awe. The man however, was bleeding from the nose after hitting his face, and the priest said, ""that was the most beautiful sound the bell has ever made, but I cannot allow you do that to yourself every hour"". Distraught, the man throws himself from the top of the bell tower to the streets below. Two men walking by see the man fall, and stop near the body. One says to the other, ""he looks familiar, do you know his name"". The other man replies, ""no, but his face rings a bell"".",0

My wife came home last night without her panties!"" ""That's nothing,"" said the other. ""Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, We'll never forget you!'",0

"A Texan Visits Israel A Texan visits Israel for vacation and spends several weeks travelling around to see the different sites. One day, while making his way through the countryside to a destination, he realizes he is quite thirsty and stops at a small farm to request a drink. The owner of the farm is quite friendly and provides the Texan with a drink of water. Israel is not a particularly large country and has a fairly large population, so the individual farmsteads are rather small. Noticing this, and feeling friendly, the Texan talks a bit. 'Back in a Texas, I'm a farmer too, although it's a bit different there. If I climb in my truck early in the morning and drive until noon across my property, I'm not even halfway across. If I keep driving until the sun sets, I'll have only reached the other end of my property, and I'll have to camp out and drive back the next day' The Israeli farmer nods before responding 'I once had a truck like that'",0

""Well,"" replies the British government, ""we do already have Karl Marx in England ... Two such great masters in the one cemetery . . . That would be overdoing it a bit...""

"Bus driver There was once a bus conductor, and he had really bad anger management problems, One day a woman on the bus refused to pay the fare. Well, the bus conductor got so angry he killed her. He was tried and sentenced to death by the electric chair. The day for his execution came, and they took him out of his cell and brought him to the chair. The guard said, ""Have you any last requests?"" The man replied, ""Yes, I'd like an unripe green banana, please."" So they got him an unripe green banana, and he peeled it, ate it, and threw the skin away, and they strapped him to the chair. ""Are you ready?"" they asked. ""Yes,"" he said. And they hit the switch. And nothing happened. So he was taken back to his cell. The guards rewired the chair and tested it a few times, and it worked perfectly. They brought the man back and said, ""Have you any last requests?"" The man replied, ""Yes, I'd like an unripe green banana, please."" So they got him an unripe green banana, and he peeled it, ate it, and threw the skin away, and they strapped him to the chair. ""Are you ready?"" they asked. ""Yes,"" he said. And they hit the switch. And nothing happened. So he was taken back to his cell. Well, the guards bought a brand new electric chair. This one was amazing: leather seats, gold-plated armrests studded with rubies, the works. It was an incredible sight. They brought the man back and asked, ""Have you any last requests?"" The man replied, ""Yes, I'd like an unripe green banana, please."" So they got him an unripe green banana, and he peeled it, ate it, and threw the skin away, and they strapped him to the chair. ""Are you ready?"" they asked. ""Yes,"" he said. And they hit the switch. And nothing happened. Now, in this particular state, there was a law that if someone survived the electric chair three times, he must be set free. So the man was released, and as soon as he stepped out of the prison, the press was all over him. He walked through the crowd and the flashing cameras until he saw a small man who asked, ""Have you discovered some miraculous phenomenon of unripe green bananas?""

God tells them that he will give them cars to drive into heaven, but first they have to tell him how many times they cheated on their wives, and they shouldn't bother lying because he has a big record book of every person's actions. God turns to the first man and asks how many times he cheated on his wife, to which the man responds ""twice."" God flips through the big book, and sure enough, the man was telling the truth. ""Since you were honest, you can get into heaven, but for cheating on your wife twice, you have to drive this 1996 Chevy Lumina for eternity,"" and he hands the man the keys. God then looks at the next man and asks the same question. ""I cheated on my wife 10 times,"" the next man replied nervously. God opened his big book, flipped through and saw that the man was telling the truth. ""For cheating on your wife 10 times, you will drive a rusty 1977 Ford Pinto for eternity"" and hands the man the keys. God then turns to the third man. ""How many times did you cheat on your wife?"" ""I never did."" God looks at the man skeptically and replies ""You know if you lie to me, you will have to spend eternity in hell. I'll give you one more chance to tell the truth. How many times did you cheat on your wife?"" ""I didn't cheat on her, God, I was always faithful."" ""Very well then."" God said, and flipped to the man's name in his book. God looks up at the man, surprised, and says ""Well what do you know? You were telling the truth! Here's a Ferrari Enzo made of solid gold to drive forever! Now go enjoy heaven, my children."" They all start driving into heaven, but then the first two men see the golden Ferrari stopped at the gate. They go to see what the problem is, and the driver is crying in the front seat.

Well, Artie picks up the dollar and just then two old women standing in line behind us start yelling and screaming at Artie that it was their dollar. The situation escalated to where they were beating on Artie's chest as he holds the dollar out of their reach. The whole time I'm thinking how ridiculous it is that these women are freaking out over one dollar, which was most likely not even theirs anyway. Artie then had enough and grabbed both of these old ladies by the throat and starts choking them. I'm really freaking out now, I mean Artie may kill these women. A police officer happened to be in the store, stopped the situation, and took Artie off to jail. The very next day I'm driving passed the store and see a sign in the window. It say's ""Artie Chokes, Two for a dollar.""",0

The bus driver noticed the homeless man eye-balling the nun as she climbed the steps and says to him, ""Would you want to have sex with that nun."" The homeless man says, ""Absolutely! I would give anything for a night with her."" The bus driver then tells him, ""Well that nun walks through the park every Friday night. At midnight exactly she always stops at the statues of Jesus and prays. What you gotta do is go by the costume shop and buy a God costume and mask, pop out from behind the statue at midnight, and she'll do anything for you. Since I feel like it's been awhile since you've had any, here $20 for the costume."" The homeless goes and buys the costume and waits behind the statue on Friday night. Sure enough, the nun shows up right at midnight. She starts to pray, but halfway through, the homeless man pops out dressed as God. ""Oh my goodness,"" says the nun when she sees him, ""is this you answering my prayers?"" ""Yes!"" booms the homeless man, ""but I must ask a favor of you. I must have sex with you so that my son may return."" ""Well,"" says the nun, ""I'm fine with that, but could you do it anally? I want to preserve my virginity so that I can stay in the nunnery."" ""Sure,"" says the homeless man. He proceeds to lift up her robe and have his way with her. After he finishes, he takes off the mask and says, ""Gotcha! I'm the guy who sat next to you at the bus stop!"" The nun then takes off her mask and says, ""Gotcha! I'm the bus driver!""",0

The representatives of the two realms agree to share him, and have him spend one year in Heaven then one year in Hell, for all eternity. His first year is spent in Hell, and when, at the end of his term, he is delivered to the Pearly Gates, God and the Devil trade a few words on the remarkable prisoner.

"Overcrowding in Heaven... So it got quite crowded in heaven, so it was decided only to only accept people who had had a really bad day on the day that they died. Three people are standing in line waiting to enter Heaven. St. Peter was standing at the pearly gates and said to the first man, ""Tell me about the day you died."" The man said, ""Oh, it was awful. To start things off, I got fired from my job. I was on the way home, and suddenly the car broke down, so I had to finish the journey on foot. Of course it started thunder-storming, and by the time I got back to my apartment, I was drenched, and even more annoyed to find out the elevators were broken. So I had to climb the stairs, all the way to my apartment on the 25th floor. When I got in, I went straight into the bedroom, and there was my wife, lying naked on the bed, clearly having just had sex. So I searched all over the apartment to try and find the bastard my wife was cheating on me with, but couldn't find him anywhere. So I went out onto the balcony to get some fresh air and clear my head, and there he was - a guy in his shorts, hanging onto the edge of my balcony just by his fingertips. So I stamped on his fingers to try and get him to fall, and eventually he gave way, and fell down. But would you believe it, he landed in some bushes and appeared to have survived. So in a fit of rage, I went back into the kitchen, dragged out the fridge, and pushed it over the edge. It fell down the 25 stories, and landed on top of him immediately crushing him. I stood there, taking in the recent events, and I was so worked up and stressed by all that had happened that I had a heart attack right there and then and died. St. Peter couldn't deny that this was a pretty bad day, and since it was a crime of passion, he let the man in. He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. ""Well, sir, it was awful,"" said the second man. ""So there I was, doing my aerobics on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment, when I suddenly I twisted my ankle and slipped over the edge. But luckily, I managed to grab the balcony of the apartment directly below me. I was just pulling myself up, when all of a sudden, some maniac came out and started stamping on my fingers! Well I fell down, but as luck would have it, I landed in some bushes. I thought I had survived the ordeal, when all of a sudden, a fucking fridge lands on my head! I was crushed to death in the most gruesome manner imaginable."" St. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really start to enjoy this job. ""Tell me about the day you died?"", he said to the third man in line. ""OK, picture this, I'm naked, hiding inside a refrigerator...""",0

You're in terrible danger!"" The preacher replies, ""No, thank you, I am a righteous man who trusts in the Almighty, and I am confident he will deliver me."" The deluge continues. The preacher is swept off the roof, carried away in the current, and drowns. He goes up to heaven, and at the pearly gates he is admitted and comes before God. The preacher asks, ""Dear Lord, I don't understand. I've been righteous and observant my whole life, and I depended on you to save me in my hour of need. Where were you?"" And the Lord answers, ""I sent you two boats and a helicopter. What more do you want?""",0

"Two guys are on their last tour of Iraq, and they get to talking and start divulging some personal information about each other. One guy is from Long Island, and his mate is from Sacramento. Spending as much time together as they did they started to become really close. One day the guy from Long Island was showing his mate some pictures of a boy that him and his wife adopted. ""We couldn't conceive because my wife had cervical cancer in her early twenties, and it took us four years but we finally got to adopt a young Spanish boy. We couldn't have been happier, his name is Jamal."" His mate looked at him with disbelief. ""You won't believe this."" As his friend rifled through his pictures he pulled out one that made both of them drop their jaws. ""I just adopted a young Spanish boy with my wife not too long ago too, look they look identical! I think we adopted twins that were separated at birth! That is to much to be a mere coincidence. My sons name is Juan and he is the biggest motivation I have to make it back home."" After much conversation, they agreed that when they got back to the states they would meet up and let their boys meet each other. After they arrived home, the fellow from Long Island was telling his wife about his mate. He told her of their intentions to make plans and meet up. He gave her all the details about his mates boy.

The boy said he had helped one customer. The director was disappointed with the boy and said he already had sellers today who had done much better than him.

The boy: ""I started off with a $0.25 fish hook which got him looking at the fishing poles. I set him up with the $100 bait master and asked him where he was gonna fish, I told him about that great lake down south but told him he'd need a car with all wheel drive to make it up the rough terrain so we got him into the $33,000 SUV we had on the lot, when he asked about boat rentals I thought I had lost him, but I ended up selling him the $60,000 riverking pro to top it off."" The manager steps back in disbelief and says ""Wow, you sold that all to a guy who came in for a fish hook? ""No"" the boy said ""The customer came in and told he had to buy tampons for his wife. I simply told him the weekend was already wrecked so he might as well go on a fishing trip"" EDIT: Thanks CowFu for improving story in my joke EDIT: Comma mistakes",0
"3 guys show up at heaven at the same time... ... St. Peter is at the gate, and informs the first one in line that, because heaven has exceeded its quota for the month, under direct orders from the man himself, he is to let in only those that have died untimely or unfortunate deaths. Understanding this, the first guy begins to tell his story, ""so I've been suspecting my wife to be cheating on me, but have never caught her in the act. I decided that today I was going to catch her. I went to work and came back home to my 24th floor condo around noon to surprise her. Walked into the bedroom and she was unusually naked in bed. I started looking around the place for the sonofabitch but he was nowhere to be found; I looked in the closets, I looked under the bed, I looked in the bathroom, I looked everywhere, and nothing. Just when I had given up, there's the mother fucker hanging on the balcony railing. I went out there and I started wailing on him with everything that I had. He wouldn't let go, so I went inside and got a hammer, and bashed his fingers. He finally fell. Can you believe that this fucker landed in some bushes, and it looked like he was about to walk away.... I was so angry at that moment that I went and dragged my refrigerator over the balcony. But all that excitement got to me and I had a heart attack."" St. Peter tells him he's free to enter heaven. Second guy steps up and St. Peter gives him the same run down as before. He acknowledges and proceeds to dish out his death. ""So I won the lotto not to long ago, and I basically work from my 25th floor condo. But the majority of my time I spend working out. So today like every other day, I put in some work in the morning then went to do my mid day workout. One of the crazier workouts I do is pull ups from my balcony. Big mistake. My hands didn't have a good grip, and I slipped. By the grace of god, I caught the railing below me. Just when I was about to start my move back up and over, this fucking guy out of nowhere comes and starts beating me. For no reason. He's beating me and I'm trying to tell him to stop. He finally does, but comes back out with a hammer. I couldn't hold on anymore, and let go. I dunno how, but I landed in some bushes. My neck and back were killing me, but I was alive. Just when I thought the angels were on my side and I started to crawl out, a fucking fridge out of nowhere comes and lands on top of me!"" St. Peter looks at him with a face, then allows him in. Third guy steps forward. St. Peter tells him the heaven population situation. Guy nods his head, claps his hands together, looks at St. Peter and says ""alright...

The old man tries to ignore it, but whoever is downstairs is being very insistent. He puts on his robe and slippers and treks down the stairs and to the front door.

I was at an ATM yesterday when a little old lady asked if I could check her balance, so I pushed her over. My neighbour knocked on my door at 2:30am this morning. Can you believe that, 2:30am?! Luckily for him I was still up playing my bagpipes. Paddy says, ""Mick, I'm thinking of buying a Labrador . ""B*gger that!"" says Mick. ""Have you seen how many of their owners go blind?"" I saw a poor old lady fall over today on the ice!! At least I presume she was poor - she only had 1.20 in her purse.

The wife was counting all the 1p's and 2p's out on the kitchen table when she suddenly got very angry and started shouting and crying for no reason. I thought to myself, ""She's going through the change."" When I was in the pub I heard a couple of plonkers saying that they wouldn't feel safe on an aircraft if they knew the pilot was a woman.

"While walking down the street one day, a US senator is tragically hit by a truck and dies... His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. ""Welcome to heaven,"" says St. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you."" ""No problem, just let me in,"" says the man. ""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity."" ""Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,"" says the senator. ""I'm sorry, but we have our rules."" And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne. Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that before he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises... The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him. ""Now it's time to visit heaven."" So, 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns. ""Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity."" The senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: ""Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell."" So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. ""I don't understand,"" stammers the senator. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?"" The devil looks at him, smiles and says, ""Yesterday we were campaigning. Today you voted.""",0

After about five minutes the old man lets another one go and says, ""Aha. I'm ahead 14 to 7."" Not to be outdone, the wife rips out another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie score."" Five seconds go by and she lets out a little squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead 17 to 14."" Now the pressure is on the old man. He refuses to get beat by a woman, so he strains real hard, but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally unacceptable he gives it everything he's got, and accidentally he shytes in the bed. The wife says, ""What the hell was that?"" The old man says, ""Half time, switch sides.""",0

Seeing the large bartender coming towards him, the 2nd string turns and goes back outside. The 3rd string says, ""well, i don't care, i'm getting a drink"".

"Made this joke after being inspired by another, sorry for the length One day in rural Minnesota, a girl called her friend up who lived just out of town to hang out. The girl's friend said that her father was still at work but she still wanted to go, so she would walk there and to expect her in an hour or more. Thirty minutes later the doorbell rang and it was her friend, covered in dirt and blood, her hair matted down, wearing only her underwear. ""Oh no! Quick, come in and let's get you cleaned up and you can borrow my clothes,"" said the girl. ""What happened to you!?"" Her friend related the story. ""Well, you know it is about five miles for me to get into town, so to get there sooner I set off right when I hung up the phone. Unfortunately, after one mile I was realizing how hungry I was, that I should have eaten before leaving the house. Just then I was passing a neighbor's house and he was outside cooking a duck he had shot. It smelled so good; I asked him for a piece. He looked me up and down and said he would give me the whole bird if I gave him a blow job. Well, I was really hungry, so that was that and I continued down the road, eating the duck. After another mile, I was just walking along and suddenly this giant deer comes bounding out of the woods and slams right into me, knocking me into the ditch! I got covered in mud and sprained my ankle. Then, being two miles from home and three miles from town, I didn't think I would make it. Fortunately a beat up old van with broken windows came down the road just then, and I waved it down. I asked the driver for a ride into town. He looked me up and down and said he would give me the whole van if I had sex with him. So, that was that and I was driving, finally entering town. Almost to your house, I looked over at the high school team playing hockey and having some sort of picnic. Suddenly a hockey puck came flying through the side window, almost hitting me if I hadn't dodged it. Dodging made me look down and notice a fat groundhog in the truck! I screamed and started swerving. The groundhog was flying around in the cab. It hit me in the stomach and I threw up all over the windshield. I couldn't see and hit some concrete benches, flying out the windshield and landing at the feet of some hockey father filling his plate with potato salad at a picnic table. He stared for a second at my bloody, dirty self and then threw up all over me! Afterwards, he was so sorry, and started to clean me off with water and a towel but it was all over my clothes. Everyone gathered around and starting helping and I was all dazed and before I knew it they had taken off my clothes to clean them off! It was so cold. The ambulance arrived and I tried to wave them off, but they ignored me and wrapped me up so tightly in this cloth on a stretcher that I could barely move or speak. Eventually, I got out to them that I just wanted to be brought to your house. They dropped me off outside, and here I am."" The girl was flabbergasted. ""Wow! Let me get this straight, it sounds like you just ran out of luck! You had to suck for a duck, got stuck in the muck from a buck, fucked for a sucky truck, ducked to avoid a puck, a woodchuck snuck in your truck, it ran amok, you were struck with the woodchuck, upchucked your duck, were covered in potluck by an awestruck schmuck, and were shucked and tucked and then brought here. Yuck!""",0

"A Nagging Wife An attorney arrived home late, after a very tough day trying to get a stay of execution for his death row client.

As soon as he walked through the door at home, his wife started on him about, What time of night to be getting home is this? Where have you been? Dinner is cold and I'm not reheating it'. And on and on and on. Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he poured himself a shot of whiskey and headed off for a long hot soak in the bathtub, pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks as he dragged himself up the stairs. While he was in the bath, the phone rang. The wife answered and was told that her husband's client, James Wright, had been granted a stay of execution after all. Wright would not be hanged tonight. Finally realizing what a terrible day he must have had, she decided to go up stairs and give him the good news. As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of her husband, bent over naked, drying his legs and feet and said ""They're not hanging Wright tonight!"" He whirled around and screamed, 'FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WOMAN, DON'T YOU EVER STOP?'",0

After about 30 minutes of the most intense love making, she puts on a robe and tells him the shower is free for him to use, and that when he's ready, to meet her downstairs in the kitchen.

"My favorite shaggy dog story to tell when I'm at the bar. A fish is swimming out in a lake, when he sees a fly flitting around, 3 feet above the water. The fish thinks to himself, ""If that fly comes down about 5 inches, I can eat it!"", so he sits and waits. A bear sees the fish watching the fly and thinks to himself, ""When that fly comes down a few inches, that fish is going to jump up and try to eat it. When that happens, I'm going to swipe that fish onto land and eat it."" A hunter eating a sandwich sees the bear watching the fish watching the fly, and thinks to himself, ""When that fly lowers, the fish is going to jump up to get it, and that bear is going to try and eat that fish. When that happens, I'm going to shoot the bear and stuff him for my den,"" so he puts down his sandwich, and readies his gun. A mouse is sitting there watching the hunter, watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly, and thinks to himself, ""When that fish goes for the fly and the bear goes for the fish, and the hunter tries too shoot the bear, I'm going to go and eat his sandwich."" so he sits and waits, keeping a watchful eye on the hunter and his sandwich. A cat in the bushes sees the mouse watching the hunter watching the bear watching the fish watching the fly, and thinks ""When that fly lowers 5 inches, the fish is going to try and eat it, then the bear is going to eat the fish, then that hunter is going to shoot the bear, then that mouse is going to try and eat the sandwich. When that happens, I'm going to eat that mouse."" so he sits and waits. watching the mouse intently. After a few tense minutes, the fly finally lowers itself. The fish jumps out of the water, and catches the fly in it's mouth a split second before the bear swipes the fish onto land and begins to devour it, shortly before being shot in the face by the hunter, while the mouse lunges for the sandwich. The cat sees the action springing right in front of him, so he books it out of the bushes making a bee line for the mouse, but misses it completely, and falls face first into the lake. Moral of the story; when a fly comes down 5 inches, a pussy gets wet.",0

"Two Asian men are drinking in a bar... And a Caucasian man walks in, carrying a shotgun. He takes a look around and then shoots one of the Asian men dead. Horrified, the bartender shouts: ""Why the fuck did you do that?!"" The man replies: ""Well, yesterday when I returned from work, this guy was on my bed, with my wife, both of them buck naked and fucking like rabbits. I yelled at them, and he punched me on my face, knocking me out. He then stripped me of my clothes, put them on, and rode away with my wife on my motorcycle! Tell me if *you* wouldn't want to kill that guy!"" The bartender, as well as everyone else in the bar, is left speechless. The man simply walks away. A couple of seconds pass by.

"I've started dating this girl with a small handicap. She's the greatest! She's smart, funny, beautiful in her own special way and so loving it eaves me at a lack of words.

We'll have a lovely day together, cheer, laugh, have fun, but she wont remember a thing in the morning. We have our burdens, but I wouldn't leave her for anything in the world!

The wife, understandably is very angry, and says: ""one day Honey, you are gonna fart your guts out."" The next Sunday, as wife is preparing Turkey for sunday lunch, her husband falls asleep. The wife spies an opportunity to get her own back, so she takes the innards of the turkey and places them in the underwear her husband is wearing. She then went back to cooking the turkey. Later on that night, her husband came to the dinner table looking very frightened. ""What happened?"" asked his wife. ""Well,"" the man said, ""you were right. I farted my guts out.""

"The only way thermodynamics are funny. A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his graduate students. It had one question: ""Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof."" Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following: ""First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.This gives two possibilities: 1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. 2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year, 'That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then 2 cannot be true, and so Hell is exothermic.""
